      "[['0', 'Abstract', {1: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">More than 1000 published experimental data of gas (O 2 and CO 2 ) and vapor (H 2 O) permeability in nanocomposites containing either spherical, elongated or platelet particles were collected, assorted and compared in order to decipher the role of particle shape on the reduction of the relative permeability of the nanocomposite. It is well known that inclusion of homogeneously dispersed and oriented impermeable fillers with high aspect ratio, such as platelets or elongated particles, should significantly increase the diffusion path of gas and vapors and yield to improve barrier properties. Results revealed that this expected impact was not systematically achieved, even for impermeable lamellar fillers that usually displayed the highest aspect ratio. More specifically, an unexpected increase of the permeability in the nanocomposite was often observed. To explain this deviation of the \\'ideal behavior\\', this paper discusses extensively the impact of the nanoparticle shape on the nanocomposite permeability along with structural aspects, related to both the particle nature and size, and the nanocomposite processing routes. Deviations from expected results of enhanced barrier effect are also discussed in correlation with unexpected variations in gas selectivity for O 2 /CO 2 pair. Lastly, this review aims at drawing meaningful conclusions on the structure/mass transfer relationships and giving directions for the development of the next generation of packaging materials with tailored mass transfer properties.</ns0:p>'}]]\n"

The mass transfers are thus at the heart of the feature of the food packaging, especially transfers of water vapor, oxygen and/or carbon dioxide, which condition the rates of numerous reactions of food degradation (oxidation, microbial development, physiological reactions, etc.). The development of bulk nanocomposite structures by introducing nanoparticles, i.e. fillers having at least one dimension lower than 100 nm, in polymeric matrices appeared as one of the most promising directions in the development of packaging materials with advanced mass transfer properties. The expected role of these inclusions is to achieve a significant decrease of the mass transfer properties as compared to the neat matrix by acting as physical obstacles to the diffusion and permeation of diffusing molecules, which have to follow a more tortuous pathway. This phenomenon is called the tortuosity effect.</ns0:p>', '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">Many types of nanoparticles have already been tested to modulate mass transfer properties, with hundreds of permeability data published in literature. Nanoparticles can be classified into three major categories according to their particle shape (Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">1</ns0:ref>): (i) isodimensional particles, that have the same size in all directions and an aspect ratio close to unity (such as spherical silica, TiO <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles, carbon black and fullerenes); (ii) elongated particles that consist in fibrils with a diameter ranging between 1 and 100 nm and length up to several hundred nanometers (such as carbon nanotubes or cellulose nanofibers); and (iii) layered particles that are characterized by one dimension ranging from several angstroms to several nanometers (such as layered silicates or starch nanocrystals). Among the three aforementioned types of particles, it is widely recognized that inclusion of impermeable platelets such as clays in the polymer should significantly enhance its barrier properties. However, an in-depth study of the available data in the literature revealed that it was not systematically the case and, even, on the contrary could lead to a deterioration of the barrier properties. Many reviews deal with the functional properties of nanocomposites, by mainly focusing on mechanical properties <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b2\">[3]</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b3\">[4]</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b4\">[5]</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b5\">[6]</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b6\">[7]</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b7\">[8]</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b8\">[9]</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b9\">[10]</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b10\">[11]</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b11\">[12]</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b12\">[13]</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b13\">[14]</ns0:ref>.

These studies generally focused on one type of nanoparticle, i.e. spherical nanoparticles or nano-platelets for instance, particularly for membrane applications.

The last exhaustive review in the field is that of Cui et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b18\">[19]</ns0:ref> that focused on gas barrier properties of clay-based polymer nanocomposites. However, the effect of the platelet-shape has never been compared and discussed along with results obtained with spherical and elongated particle shape. In spite of all these preceding reviews, there is still a huge lack of analysis of all available data in the perspective of deciphering the role of particle shape on the mass transfer properties of the resulting nanocomposite materials, even if it has been highlighted as a key input parameter in mathematical models. As far as we knew, there is no review that proposes an exhaustive analysis of the experimental permeability values from the available literature.</ns0:p>', '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">In order to better correlate the mass transfer properties in nanocomposite materials with their multi-scale structure, the objective of the present review is to decipher and comprehensively discuss the role of the nanoparticle shape (either isodimensional, elongated or layered) on the modulation of the mass transfer properties in nanocomposites, as a function of filler volume fraction and in the light of the nanocomposite structure achieved. For that purpose, more than 1000 values (i.e. about 170 articles) of the 1995-2015 period containing measured values of O <sub>2</sub> , CO <sub>2</sub> and H <sub>2</sub> O permeability in polymer-based nanocomposites were collected from the available literature and capitalized in a dedicated on-line database <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b19\">[20]</ns0:ref>. All data could be uploaded from the permalink provided in figure caption (https://doi.org/10.5281/ zenodo.1136269). The proposed on-line database consists in the first and unprecedented compilation of permeability values for nanocomposite based materials. The current work is focused on direct analysis and comparison of experiments, without any mediation which could be provided by quantitative models. It must be specified that, in order to build up the database for analysis, which is of interest here, recent data for gas barrier in polymer based materials with dispersed graphene and graphene derivatives were not taken into consideration. In fact, while the latter represent nanocomposite materials with dispersed layered domains, the extremely high aspect ratio and flexibility of graphene layers reduces the threshold value for percolation in these materials to much lower values than in traditional layered particles nanocomposites <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b20\">[21]</ns0:ref>. Under those conditions, in the volume concentration range for layered particles which is of reference in this work (in the order of 10% by volume) layers arrangement and layer defects are significantly more relevant to the barrier effect than the aspect ratio (particle shape) itself. For a comparison between gas barrier properties in polymer/clay and polymer/graphene nanocomposite see the review by Tan <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b21\">[22]</ns0:ref>. For the above reason, although graphene has attracted much attention in recent years for the production of polymer based composites for packaging, analysis of pertinent results for gas barrier properties is left to a different discussion and the interested reader is addressed to recent reviews in the field <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b22\">[23]</ns0:ref>.</ns0:p>', '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">Besides the meaningful conclusions on the role of nanoparticle shape, the main output of this paper is to give some recommendations for the design of nanocomposite packaging materials with tunable mass transfer properties.</ns0:p>']], ['2', 'Brief overview of nanocomposites processing and morphologies', ['<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">All the processes used to prepare polymer-based nanocomposites have already been extensively detailed in dedicated reviews and are not further detailed here.

Due to the large range of polymer matrices and nanoparticles, different processing routes have been proposed to produce nanocomposites based on their convenience according to the nature of the raw constituents and their field of application (Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">2</ns0:ref>). At laboratory scale, four main processes are most commonly used to prepare polymer-based nanocomposites from all the types of nanoparticles. Melt processing and solution blending are two processes based on the use of polymers, which lead to the formation of Van der Waals interactions between the constituents, while insitu polymerization and sol/gel methods are based on the use of monomers or oligomers, leading to the formation of covalent bonds between the polymer and the nanoparticles (Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">2</ns0:ref>). At industrial scale, melt processing is generally preferred due to the difficulty to implement processes requiring the use of huge volumes of solvent.</ns0:p>', '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">Depending on the processing conditions, the particle shape and the affinity between constituents, i.e. the polymer matrix and the nanoparticle, different morphologies can be obtained. For isodimensional and elongated nanoparticles, three arrangements can be observed, i.e. (i) well-dispersed, (ii) agglomerated, or (iii) percolating systems. For platelets, specific names are given to the various possible morphologies: (i) micro-composite, (ii) intercalated nanocomposite or (iii) fully exfoliated nanocomposites.

Similar analyses of the problem can be found in the field of electrical properties (electrical conductivity/permittivity) as well as in that of heat or mass transfer (thermal conductivity/mass diffusivity). Exact solutions in terms of effective conductivity of the composite medium have been obtained already by Maxwell in 1873 <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b25\">[26]</ns0:ref> for the case of dilute mixture of spherical domains (\"non-interacting particles\") perfectly adhering to the matrix. These exact solutions assume that the properties of dispersed and continuous phase in the composite are the same than the one measured in the corresponding pure materials (\"ideal interface condition\").</ns0:p>', '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">Wiener <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b26\">[27]</ns0:ref> in 1912 extended the results to the case of dilute dispersion of long cylinders in the matrix, all aligned in the direction normal to the overall flux. While exact solutions are also available for the case of spheroids (dilute mixture, perfect alignment), empirical relations as well as numerical result have been discussed for the case of different shapes of the inclusions. Among the best, known results of this kind are those obtained by Nielsen <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b27\">[28]</ns0:ref> in 1967 following empirical ideas about the increase in contour length of path of diffusing molecules in the composite medium due to the presence of impermeable inclusions in the form of bricks. The specific expression for effective conductivity as function of particle concentration in the composite as derived from the above models is not here presented and discussed, as the direct comparison of available experimental results with model predictions is not relevant to this work. On the other hand, it is useful to remember here that all the above approaches consistently predict a decrease in the conductivity when the concentration of impermeable particles in the composite increases. In general terms, it can be said that, assuming ideal interface and non-interacting particle condition, the effective conductivity of the composite medium is expected to be half the value of the pure matrix when the concentration of dispersed phase approaches 40% vol for isometric particles, 30% vol for elongated particles aligned normally to the flux, and a much lower value, only few percent, depending on the exact shape, for layered particles lying in planes orthogonal to the flux.</ns0:p>', '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">It should be finally mentioned that more complex analyses are definitely needed to consider the interaction between particles in the medium (concentrated mixtures), the distribution in their orientation, as well the non-ideal interaction with the matrix which can ultimately result in regions close to the interface with properties different from that of pure materials <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b28\">[29]</ns0:ref>.

All these papers, dealing with nanocomposite materials, presented at least one value of permeability in relation to their composition. The nanoparticles considered in works examined in this review are those assumed as impermeable and non-porous with respect to the application that is focused on: barrier membranes mainly for packaging application. Moreover, it must be noted that mass transfer does not follow the same mechanisms in dense and porous material and that mixing porous and non-porous materials may disturb the analysis. Only gases (O <sub>2</sub> and CO <sub>2</sub> ) and water vapor permeability data were considered because of their high interest for food packaging applications. These data were analyzed as regard to the particle shape (isodimensional, elongated, or platelet), the filler volume fraction, the eventual chemical and functionalization treatments applied to the nanoparticle and the elaboration technique used to prepare materials. The main characteristics of the nanocomposites studied in the present review are gathered in Tables 1-3.</ns0:p>', '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">In the following, the evolution of the relative permeability, i.e. the ratio of the composite permeability to the permeability of the neat matrix (P/P <sub>0</sub> ), was represented as a function of the nanoparticle volume fraction (φ <sub>vol</sub> ), which is considered as input parameter in all mathematical models.

Papers dealing with elongated particle displaying micrometric sizes (13 papers more) were voluntary excluded from this review. Due to the high number of studies found for each type of particle shape (for O <sub>2</sub> , CO <sub>2</sub> and H <sub>2</sub> O permeability), the figures are overloaded and thus not easily readable. Three complementary figures have been drawn for each type of particle shape and for each molecule studied, i.e. O <sub>2</sub> , H <sub>2</sub> O and CO <sub>2</sub> respectively.

For filler content higher than 10 vol%, the decrease in permeability is not confirmed anymore. We noted that studies conducted with such high amounts of platelets (&gt; 10 vol%) were scarce, which makes it difficult to generalize the effect of high contents of platelets on the permeability of resulting nanocomposites (Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_8\">5c</ns0:ref>).</ns0:p>', '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">To sum up, beyond the fact that modulation of the permeability is clearly affected by the shape of the nanoparticles, three conclusions (i) whatever the filler content, the addition of isodimensional particles does not statistically impact the permeability of resulting nanocomposites very much, (ii) a significant decrease of permeability could be achieved by nanostructuring polymer matrices with the introduction of either elongated or nanoplatelets-shaped nanoparticles, with a much higher efficiency of layered nanoparticles.

For the sake of clarity, the exhaustive list of these references is in footnote. <super>1</super> The amplitude of this decrease largely depends on the particle shape and/or particle volume fraction used. The authors mainly attributed this result to (1) a tortuosity effect induced by the nanostructure created by the incorporation of an impermeable particle, and to a lesser extent to (2) the modification of the polymer matrix properties by the presence of nanoparticles, or (3) the modification of the availability of specific sorption sites for the sorption of the diffusing molecule. These three assumptions will be discussed in the following paragraphs.</ns0:p>']], ['4.1.1', 'Tortuosity effect', ['<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">When impermeable nanoparticles are incorporated within a polymer matrix, they act as an obstacle to the diffusion and thus the permeation of diffusing molecules, which have to follow a more tortuous pathway. Mathematically, tortuosity (τ) represents the ratio of the distance that a molecular specie must follow through the nanocomposite thickness to the distance through the neat polymer.</ns0:p>', '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">This tortuosity effect is influenced by the volume fraction and the  <super>1</super> Among studies that observed a decrease of P/P <sub>0</sub> , we can cite the following papers:</ns0:p>', '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">For spherical particles: dispersion and distribution states of nanoparticles within the polymer matrix. Concretely, it could be related to two quantitative parameters, i.e. the in-situ size aspect ratio of the particle and the orientation of nanoparticles.</ns0:p>', '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">4.1.1.1. In-situ particle aspect ratio. The size aspect ratio of a nanoparticle is defined as the ratio of its longest dimension to its lowest dimension. Considering the different possible shapes of nanoparticles, it is obvious that the size aspect ratio of a sphere, equal to 1, is lower than that of elongated nanoparticles and nanoplatelets for which very high size aspect ratio could be achieved. The achievement of high size aspect ratios theoretically favors the establishment of a more tortuous pathway. This effect is all the greater for nanoplatelets that allow the creation of 2D obstacles. This has been experimentally validated by Gatos et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b29\">[30]</ns0:ref> who prepared by melt processing fully-exfoliated nanocomposites from a hydrogenated acrylonitrile butadiene rubber polymer and two layered silicates displaying different sizes, i.e. octadecylamine modified montmorillonites with a size aspect ratio of 100 and synthetic fluorohectorite with a size aspect ratio of 200. They observed that the highest decrease of oxygen permeability was achieved using the fluorohectorite as filler, which was ascribed to its higher aspect ratio <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b29\">[30]</ns0:ref>. It must be noted that the achievement of such high in-situ size aspect ratios is exceptional. Indeed, the formation of stacks or tactoïds within the polymer matrix is usually obtained due to the agglomeration and/or incomplete exfoliation of nanoplatelets, resulting in a decrease of the theoretical size aspect ratio. An intercalated nanocomposite structure is thus less tortuous than a full-exfoliated structure. This implies that the in-situ size aspect ratio is usually different from the one of the native nanoparticle. As an example, Angellier-Coussy et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b30\">[31]</ns0:ref> found average values of in-situ size aspect ratio of 17 and 23 for 10.8 and 2.2 vol% of filler, respectively in wheat gluten/montmorillonite based nanocomposites while the size aspect ratio of one native nanoparticle was about 80. This issue is the same for elongated nanoparticles where agglomeration often occurs.</ns0:p>', '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">In practice, the knowledge of the in-situ size aspect ratio is thus necessary to fully understand and predict the impact of tortuosity on mass transfer properties. It is usually evaluated using image analysis of TEM pictures when nanoparticles can be easily distinguished from the matrix as is the case for montmorillonite <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b30\">[31]</ns0:ref>. This analysis is tricky and time consuming. Indeed, a large number of images must be analyzed to obtain a significant representativeness of the whole material. In addition, it is well-known that TEM analysis has some inherent limitations due to the fact that it projects three-dimensional (3D) objects onto a two-dimensional (2D) plane, resulting in TEM cross-sections that do not necessarily represent the actual size of all the platelets <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b31\">[32]</ns0:ref>. Furthermore, an ideal image would exhibit sharp transitions from black to white, what is not the case in reality, necessitating the conversion of the original grey-scale TEM micrograph into a black and white image using a semi-automated approach, this step being inevitably accompanied by errors. And finally, this evaluation must be done for each filler content, since the dispersion state strongly depends on the filler content. All these limitations probably explain why the evaluation of the in-situ size aspect ratio is rarely experimentally determined. It is usually an imprecise, unrealistic (if the size aspect ratio of the native nanoparticle is considered) or missing data.</ns0:p>', '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">4.1.1.2. In-situ size aspect ratio and dispersion state. As explained above, the in-situ aspect ratio strongly depends on the particle dispersion state. Contrary to the in-situ size aspect ratio, which is rarely determined, the impact of the particle dispersion state on nanocomposite mass transfer properties has been largely demonstrated. For example, Koh et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b32\">[33]</ns0:ref> demonstrated with PLA/organo-modified montmorillonites nanocomposites that the highest decrease of the oxygen and carbon dioxide permeability was obtained for the most exfoliated structure. The same positive impact of exfoliation on permeability decrease was also obtained by Sanchez-Garcia et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b33\">[34]</ns0:ref> in PHBV-PCL nanocomposites and by Sun et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b34\">[35]</ns0:ref> for α-zirconium phosphate/ epoxy resin nanocomposites.</ns0:p>', '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">It is worth noting that the achievement of a good dispersion state is all the more difficult as the filler content increases due to agglomeration phenomena, as evidenced in many systems such as agar-(Rhim et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b35\">[36]</ns0:ref>), polyester-(Bharadwaj et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b36\">[37]</ns0:ref>), polyamide-(Picard et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b37\">[38]</ns0:ref>) or polyimide-(Chang et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b38\">[39]</ns0:ref>) based nanocomposites with montmorillonite as nanoparticles. Chemical modification of nanoparticles does not always prevent agglomeration, as evidenced by Zhu et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b39\">[40]</ns0:ref> with modified SiO <sub>2</sub> particles in poly (vinyl chloride) matrix.</ns0:p>', '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">4.1.1.3. Orientation. To obtain an optimal decreasing effect on permeability, the largest surface of each nanoparticle must be oriented perpendicular to the direction of the gas diffusion or permeation. Well-oriented and aligned particles perpendicularly to the permeation flux have more impact on the decrease of the permeability than disoriented particles as regards the tortuosity effect. This effect of orientation is only valid for elongated particles and nanoplatelets and, of course, all the more significant for particles with high size aspect ratios. This effect of orientation is also theoretically much more efficient for nanoparticles displaying high size aspect ratio in two dimensions (such as platelets) than only in one dimension (such as elongated particles). In practice, it is an extremely challenging task to achieve a regular arrangement of nanoparticles within the polymer matrix. It is strongly dependent on processing methods. Solution intercalation and in-situ-polymerization are more prone to produce nanostructures with well-aligned and oriented particles than melt intercalation as observed by several authors. It is all the more difficult that particles display high aspect ratio in 2dimension such as platelets. For example, Messersmith et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b40\">[41]</ns0:ref> showed that montmorillonites adopted a planar orientation in the poly (ε-caprolactone) polymer matrix after in-situ-polymerization and solution casting processing while Sanchez-Garcia et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b41\">[42]</ns0:ref> noted that it was difficult to obtain, using melt processing and compression moulding, well aligned and oriented montmorillonites in PHBV-PCL polymer and that a random orientation is at best the most often achieved.</ns0:p>']], ['4.1.2', 'Modification of the polymer matrix', ['<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">The incorporation of nanoparticles can modify the structure and thus the mass transfer properties of the polymer matrix itself. The two main structural modifications reported to contribute to the decrease of P/P <sub>0</sub> are (i) a reduction of polymer free volume associated to an increase in the glass transition temperature and/or (ii) an increase in crystallinity due to a nucleating effect of nanoparticles. The effect of polymer free volume was for example evidenced in the study of Sadeghi et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b42\">[43]</ns0:ref> by a reduction of the polymer chain mobility in the amorphous phase in the case of polyurethane-silica nanocomposites. The impact of nanoparticles on polymer crystallinity was largely reported for either spherical particles such as silica nanoparticles (Vladimirov et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b43\">[44]</ns0:ref>; Vassiliou et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b44\">[45]</ns0:ref>) or layered particles such as montmorillonite (Sanchez-Garcia et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b41\">[42]</ns0:ref>; Ghasemi et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b45\">[46]</ns0:ref>).

A side effect of this higher affinity is a decrease of the availability of the sorption sites in the polymer. It is particularly true for highly interactive molecules such as water vapor that interacts though hydrogen bonding with hydrophilic sites. These sites bonded with the nanoparticles are not any more available for water sorption. Such changes in specific interactions between the migrant and the polymer were proposed to explain the decrease of water vapor permeability observed by Tunc et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b46\">[47]</ns0:ref> in wheat gluten/montmorillonite or by Lee et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b47\">[48]</ns0:ref> in soy protein/ montmorillonite nanocomposites.</ns0:p>']], ['4.2', 'Monotonic increase of the permeability', ['<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">Several assumptions are proposed in literature to explain either the absence of significant modification or even an increase of the permeability in nanocomposites: (1) an insufficient tortuosity effect, (2) the occurrence of macroscopic structural defects in the nanocomposite material induced for instance by particles agglomeration, (3) a significant modification of the structure of the polymer matrix such as a decrease of crystallinity or molecular weight, and (4) an increase of migrant sorption induced by nanoparticles (case of water vapor for example, for water sensitive materials). It is worth noting that some mechanisms assumed to explain an increase of P/P <sub>0</sub> were previously discussed for explaining a decrease of P/P <sub>0</sub> (Section 3.1).</ns0:p>']], ['4.2.1', 'Lack of tortuosity effect', ['<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">In some cases, the dispersion state of nanoparticles did not allow to achieve a sufficient tortuosity effect to slow down the diffusion of migrating molecules, especially for small molecules such as gases. Such an explanation is widely proposed to explain why values of permeability did not change or only slightly decreased in the nanocomposite as compared to the neat matrix. This has been, for example, proposed by Tunc et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b46\">[47]</ns0:ref> to explain the constancy of O <sub>2</sub> permeability in wheat gluten/montmorillonite nanocomposites. In the same article, authors however demonstrated that the achieved tortuosity was nevertheless sufficient for decreasing permeability of bigger molecules such as aroma compounds. This highlighted that the nature, molecular weight and/or steric hindrance of the migrant are also key parameters governing the mass transfer properties in nanocomposites. 4.2.2. Macroscopic structural defects 4.2.2.1. Particle agglomeration. The presence of both nano-or microsized agglomerates and aggregates of particles could induce macroscopic structural defects, which play a major role in the increase of P/P <sub>0</sub> , as already shown for either spherical-based composites with SiO <sub>2</sub> (Cornelius et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b48\">[49]</ns0:ref>), TiO <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (Zoppi et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b49\">[50]</ns0:ref>) or cylinder-based composites with cellulose fibrils (Bilbao-Sainz et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b50\">[51]</ns0:ref>). These agglomeration phenomena are related to a bad dispersion of the nanoparticles which is mainly ascribed to (1) mismatching of the particle polarity, as compared to that of the polymer, resulting in a low affinity between constituents and thus a poor particle/polymer adhesion <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b49\">[50]</ns0:ref> and/or (2) inefficiency of the elaboration technique to separate aggregates.</ns0:p>', '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">For example, insufficient shearing forces during the melt processing could cause agglomeration of particles. During casting, sol-gel method and in-situ polymerization, coalescence of the particles during drying of the solution could appear through insufficient particle/particle interactions (\"bad compatibility\"). This last phenomenon is normally limited by chemical modification of the surface of the particles. But when the effect of this chemical modification is wrongly anticipated it could even amplify/trigger coalescence of particles as evidenced by Zhu et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b39\">[40]</ns0:ref> in their study of H <sub>2</sub> 0 and O <sub>2</sub> permeability of silica/PVC nanocomposites with SiO <sub>2</sub> surface grafted with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). They noticed that high content of filling (&gt; 2.5 vol/vol%) increased the permeability of both O <sub>2</sub> and H <sub>2</sub> 0 due to an agglomeration phenomenon owing to the tendency of nanoscale silica modified nanoparticles to be fused together at this concentration. This phenomenon was not anticipated.</ns0:p>', '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">Agglomeration could lead to the formation of \"interfacial voids\" at the particle/polymer matrix interface and to the formation of a preferential pathway for the migration of the molecular penetrant (Ismail et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b51\">[52]</ns0:ref>, Rafiq et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b52\">[53]</ns0:ref>). This is further detailed below in the section dedicated to the \"interphase\". 4.2.2.2. Interphase. An interphase, i.e. a \"third compartment\" with its own properties, is generated at the particles/polymer interface due to the establishment of either weak or strong interfacial interactions between the particles and the polymer matrix. Depending on its nature and thickness (or volume fraction), the interphase could significantly participate to the overall mass transfer properties and strongly influence the overall permeability of the composite as evidenced by Liang et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b53\">[54]</ns0:ref> in their poly(ethersulfone)/ montmorillonite nanocomposites.

An increase of free volume was also hypothesized to occur when using compatibilizing agents due to bad compatibility between the compatibilizer and the surface treated particles (Mittal et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b59\">[60]</ns0:ref>). The addition of nanoparticles in a polymer matrix could also hinder the crystallization process if chain mobility is hindered, leading thus to a decrease of the overall crystallinity of the polymer that could contribute to enhance the overall mass transfer within the composite (Dougnac et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b56\">[57]</ns0:ref>).</ns0:p>', '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">We noted that this increase of free volume is often considered as a global explanation resulting from different phenomena: in addition to the modification of polymer matrix, increase in free volume could also result in void space formation by nanoparticles aggregation and weak interaction between polymer-nanoparticles at interface (Moghadam et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b55\">[56]</ns0:ref>). All these mechanisms are not easily distinguished. Therefore, authors stressed an overall increase of free volume that they experimentally assessed by density measurements, without distinguishing all underlying mechanisms. Indeed, if the density of the nanoparticles, crystalline polymer and amorphous polymer phases has their pure component values in the nanocomposites, then the density of a nanocomposite sample, would be equal to the theoretical additive density. The difference between theoretical and experimental densities can be rationalized by the overall increase of free volume as evidenced by (Matteucci et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b54\">[55]</ns0:ref>) in spherical-based composites with titanium dioxide.</ns0:p>']], ['4.2.4', 'Increasing migrant sorption', ['<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">The increase of P/P <sub>0</sub> could be related to the establishment of specific interactions between the molecular penetrant and the material constituents, as largely observed for water vapor and hygroscopic nanoparticles such as silica nanoparticles (Bracho et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b60\">[61]</ns0:ref>, Dougnac et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b56\">[57]</ns0:ref>) or microcrystalline cellulose (Dogan et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b61\">[62]</ns0:ref>), and also for O <sub>2</sub> and organo-modified montmorillonite (Chang et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b62\">[63]</ns0:ref>), for O <sub>2</sub> or modified silica nanoparticles (Iwata et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b63\">[64]</ns0:ref>) or CO <sub>2</sub> and titanium dioxide nanoparticles (Matteucci et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b54\">[55]</ns0:ref>).</ns0:p>', '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">Different mechanisms could occur concomitantly, explaining why significant effects on P/P <sub>0</sub> are not systematically observed.

The latter effect was also hypothesized by Kono et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b74\">[75]</ns0:ref> and Ahn et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b75\">[76]</ns0:ref> on silica nanoparticle based nanocomposite. The diffusivity could also remain constant or increase with the addition of impermeable particles due to bad adhesion or compatibility between constituents or the creation of interconnected cavities/channels as evidenced by Suzuki et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b72\">[73]</ns0:ref>, Kim et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b69\">[70]</ns0:ref> and Cong et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b70\">[71]</ns0:ref>.</ns0:p>', '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">To sum up, following analysis of all aforementioned experimental evidences, we can conclude that there is generally a competition between an increase of the solubility and a decrease of the diffusivity. Therefore, non-monotonic changes of P/P <sub>0</sub> , in peculiar, decrease of P/ P <sub>0</sub> followed by an increase for higher particle volume fraction, could be generally ascribed to an increase of S that could, from a threshold value of particle volume fraction, counteract the decrease of D.</ns0:p>']], ['4.5', 'Discussion of the selective transport characteristics of nanocomposite membranes', ['<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">In the context of developing barrier films, it is also interesting to Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">6</ns0:ref>.

It is indeed of high interest in many applications to develop nanocomposites that are designed to provide a very strong barrier to one component (for instance oxygen) while remaining permeable to another (such as carbon dioxide or water vapor). In this purpose, CO <sub>2</sub> / O <sub>2</sub> selectivity and H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity were calculated, when possible, from the data gathered in the framework of this study and plotted as a function of the nanoparticle volume fraction (Figs. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">7 and 8</ns0:ref>). In most of cases, CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> and H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity was not initially in the objective of the original works used to derive it. Therefore, it was not systematically possible to calculate it from the permeability data available per reference. It must be noted that for the sake of clarity, for H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity, the ratio of nanocomposite selectivity to neat polymer selectivity is used in Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">8</ns0:ref> while absolute values of PCO <sub>2</sub> /PO <sub>2</sub> are directly plotted in Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">7</ns0:ref>, because they display less range of variation.</ns0:p>', '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">As it can be seen in Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">7</ns0:ref>, and in the logic of result of the Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_6\">3</ns0:ref> analysis, there are much more data of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity available for layered particles than for iso-dimensional particles and elongated ones where only four references have permitted to calculate this value. It is thus not possible to draw meaningful conclusions about the evolution of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity for elongated nanoparticles-based nanocomposites (Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">7b</ns0:ref>).</ns0:p>', '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">Logically, CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity of layered particles-based nanocomposites was centered around a mean value of 4, which is usually the permselectivity of oil-based polymers used as neat matrix in most of the studies (Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">7c</ns0:ref>).

Two studies nevertheless lead to an increase of the CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity as a function of nanoparticle volume fraction <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b77\">[78,</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b78\">79]</ns0:ref>. In the work of Meera et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b78\">[79]</ns0:ref>, the decrease of permeability as a function of filler content is much higher for O <sub>2</sub> than for CO <sub>2</sub> leading to an increase of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permeability ratio while it seems to be the contrary for Merinska et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b77\">[78]</ns0:ref>. In the same time and for another combination of filler/polymer (Nanofill 5 as MMT/PP), the data of Merinska et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b77\">[78]</ns0:ref> permitted to obtain a decrease of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity. Alena et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b79\">[80]</ns0:ref> also observed either an increase or decrease of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity depending on the type of nanoparticle (MMT) used in LDPE matrix. These last features confirm the random nature of the evolution of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity as a function of nanoparticle volume fraction. We noted that this notion of permselectivity and its evolution as a function of filler content was never explained nor even highlighted by the aforementioned group of authors.</ns0:p>', '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">For isodimensional particles-based nanocomposites, the CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity is also centered around a value of 5 (Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">7a</ns0:ref>) and kept almost constant as a function of filler volume fraction. Nevertheless, a group of 5 studies displays very high CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity (&gt; 15). Among this group of studies, we noted a general trend toward an increase of permselectivity with nanoparticle volume fraction (4 studies <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b42\">[43,</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b69\">70,</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b80\">81,</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b81\">82]</ns0:ref> observing an increase against only one <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b49\">[50]</ns0:ref> observing a decrease). Variation of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity in the aforementioned studies was principally due to the fact that O <sub>2</sub> and CO <sub>2</sub> permeability did not decrease as much as a function of filler content resulting in a nonconstant PCO <sub>2</sub> /PO <sub>2</sub> ratio. Results of Zoppi et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b49\">[50]</ns0:ref> and Kim et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b69\">[70]</ns0:ref> with high CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity were obtained on PEBAX® (copolymer with polyamide-6 and poly(ethyleneoxide)) which is known to display high CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> selectivity in packaging application. These authors did not try to explain why the CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity varied in their sample: Kim et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b69\">[70]</ns0:ref> focused only on CO <sub>2</sub> /He, CO <sub>2</sub> /N <sub>2</sub> and O <sub>2</sub> /N <sub>2</sub> selectivity and did not notice any variation of these selectivities as a function of nanoparticle volume fraction (about 6 for CO <sub>2</sub> /He, 70 for CO <sub>2</sub> /N <sub>2</sub> and 3 for O <sub>2</sub> /N <sub>2</sub> respectively); Zoppi et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b49\">[50]</ns0:ref> focusing on O <sub>2</sub> / N <sub>2</sub> , CO <sub>2</sub> /CH <sub>4</sub> , CO <sub>2</sub> /N <sub>2</sub> and CO <sub>2</sub> /H <sub>2</sub> selectivity did not notice so much variation of this value as a function of nanoparticle content except for very high volume ratio (15 vol/vol%). Only Semsarzadeh et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b81\">[82]</ns0:ref> calculated the CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity in their study on polyurethane-silica/polyvinyl alcohol mixed matrix membranes. They noticed that by increasing the silica content in membranes, all gas permselectivities including CO <sub>2</sub> , namely CO <sub>2</sub> /N <sub>2</sub> , CO <sub>2</sub> /CH <sub>4</sub> and CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> increased much more than selectivity including other gases such as O <sub>2</sub> / N <sub>2</sub> , up to 136%, 69% and 47%, respectively. They explained that, while O <sub>2</sub> , N <sub>2</sub> and CH <sub>4</sub> displayed decreasing permeability, CO <sub>2</sub> permeability demonstrated an increase upon increasing silica content due to an increase in the number of the active sites (polar OH groups) for gas dissolution in polymer matrix. The same reduced decrease in CO <sub>2</sub> permeability compared to other gases such as O <sub>2</sub> or N <sub>2</sub> was observed by Sadeghi et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b42\">[43,</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b80\">81]</ns0:ref> in polyether-based polyurethane-silica and polyurethane-silica nanocomposite leading to moderate increase of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> selectivity as a function of nanoparticle content (Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">7a</ns0:ref>).</ns0:p>', '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">The comparative examination of permeability and selectivity variation of data collected in the database considered in this work is now in order. Indeed, for the case of inclusion of impermeable particles in a permeable polymer matrix, the anticipated mechanism of induced tortuosity in path of gas molecules is expected to reduce the permeability of different gases by the same extent. A further analysis was thus performed to explore possible correlation between relative permeability and permselectivity in the available set of data. The examination is confined to the case of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> selectivity in nanocomposite obtained from the inclusion of isodimensional or platelet shaped nanoparticles, as only for those cases is a sufficient number of data available to insure the significance of the statistical analysis. In Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_9\">9</ns0:ref> the relative permeability for CO <sub>2</sub> in the nanocomposites is related to the corresponding square variation of permselectivity δ defined as follows:</ns0:p>', '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">where α <sub>NC</sub> and α <sub>M</sub> are CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity in nanocomposite and neat matrix, respectively. Despite the scattering, data in Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_9\">9</ns0:ref> put in evidence that, both for the case of isodimensional particles and platelets, relative permeability higher than one is typically accompanied by a significant deviation of nanocomposite permselectivity from the value of neat matrix, while an interval exists for relative permeability of nanocomposite moderately lower than 1, for which the deviation in permselectivity from the value of neat matrix is negligible. Significantly, the above interval for relative permeability extends to lower values for the case of nanocomposites including platelets with respect to the case of isodimensional particles. It can be thus concluded that a good number of studies considered in this work shows results which are at least qualitatively consistent with the picture resulting from the tortuosity effect induced by the dispersed phase to the motion of gas molecules. On the other hand, a large number of nanocomposites exhibiting either relative permeability values higher than one or very low seems to be often characterized by significant variation of the permselectivity, indicating the relevance of additional phenomena hiding the effect of a pure increase in tortuosity path for the motion of gas molecules in the system. As it can be seen in Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">8</ns0:ref>, data available to calculate H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity are much scarcer than for CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> and, for this reason, the correlation between relative permeability and deviation of permselectivity is not discussed here for this kind of data. No values were even found in the collected references for calculated H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity in iso-dimensional nanoparticle based nanocomposites. Only three references were found for elongated ones. O <sub>2</sub> permeability is rarely investigated concomitantly to H <sub>2</sub> O permeability although H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity is a very important value in many applications such as packaging where sometimes a high barrier property to O <sub>2</sub> is required at the same time as low barrier to H <sub>2</sub> 0. From Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">8</ns0:ref>, it can be concluded that the H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity did not vary so much as a function of nanoparticle volume fraction except for the study of Kasirga et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b73\">[74]</ns0:ref>, Chang et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b38\">[39]</ns0:ref> and Lee et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b47\">[48]</ns0:ref> where H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity tended to dramatically increase then decrease for at least Chang et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b38\">[39]</ns0:ref> and Lee et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b47\">[48]</ns0:ref>. Even if none of these authors intentionally measured nor explained the evolution of H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity, this behavior could be generally ascribed to a better tortuosity effect obtained for H <sub>2</sub> O than for O <sub>2</sub> and, for non-monotonic behavior, to nonlinear decrease in permeability with clay loading.</ns0:p>', '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">To conclude about the selective transport characteristics of nanocomposites membranes, the previous analysis has highlighted that a correlation exists between permeability and the corresponding selectivity value which could be used to emphasize that deviations from expected behavior for selectivity (either positive or negative variation of selectivity) are often associated with deviations from expected behavior for permeability (very high reduction or increase).</ns0:p>']], ['5', 'Conclusion', ['<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">The recently-measured values of gas (O <sub>2</sub> , CO <sub>2</sub> ) and water vapor permeability in agro-, bio-and synthetic-based nanocomposites have been comprehensively reviewed with emphases on the link between their micro-and nano-structure and their barrier performance.</ns0:p>', '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">This review has revealed that despite numerous and intensive studies on the optimization of nanocomposite processing and structure in the perspective of modulating their barrier properties, the expected decreasing effect on the permeability is often not so high as expected and sometimes completely the opposite. This review confirmed that layered nanoparticles are more efficient than isodimensional and elongated nanoparticles to decrease the relative permeability (P/P <sub>0</sub> ). But, this effect is difficult to anticipate due to numerous interfering mechanisms that provoke modifications of tortuosity, sorption, polymer matrix (crystallinity, free volume, molar mass), creation of an interphase, voids and cracks, and more that lead to unexpected behaviors of the permeability in nanocomposites. Investigation of the selective transport of CO <sub>2</sub> to O <sub>2</sub> and H <sub>2</sub> 0 to O <sub>2</sub> did not reveal a general trend either and it is also difficult to anticipate.</ns0:p>', '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">It was concluded that tortuosity, the main mechanism proposed to explain permeability decrease in nanocomposites, often fails in explaining the effect of nanoparticles on nanocomposite barrier properties. This is particularly important knowing that most of the mathematical models used to predict permeability in nanocomposites are based on this tortuosity effect.</ns0:p>']]]\n"

The mass transfers are thus at the heart of the feature of the food packaging, especially transfers of water vapor, oxygen and/or carbon dioxide, which condition the rates of numerous reactions of food degradation (oxidation, microbial development, physiological reactions, etc.). The development of bulk nanocomposite structures by introducing nanoparticles, i.e. fillers having at least one dimension lower than 100 nm, in polymeric matrices appeared as one of the most promising directions in the development of packaging materials with advanced mass transfer properties. The expected role of these inclusions is to achieve a significant decrease of the mass transfer properties as compared to the neat matrix by acting as physical obstacles to the diffusion and permeation of diffusing molecules, which have to follow a more tortuous pathway. This phenomenon is called the tortuosity effect.</ns0:p>', '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">Many types of nanoparticles have already been tested to modulate mass transfer properties, with hundreds of permeability data published in literature. Nanoparticles can be classified into three major categories according to their particle shape (Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">1</ns0:ref>): (i) isodimensional particles, that have the same size in all directions and an aspect ratio close to unity (such as spherical silica, TiO <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles, carbon black and fullerenes); (ii) elongated particles that consist in fibrils with a diameter ranging between 1 and 100 nm and length up to several hundred nanometers (such as carbon nanotubes or cellulose nanofibers); and (iii) layered particles that are characterized by one dimension ranging from several angstroms to several nanometers (such as layered silicates or starch nanocrystals). Among the three aforementioned types of particles, it is widely recognized that inclusion of impermeable platelets such as clays in the polymer should significantly enhance its barrier properties. However, an in-depth study of the available data in the literature revealed that it was not systematically the case and, even, on the contrary could lead to a deterioration of the barrier properties. Many reviews deal with the functional properties of nanocomposites, by mainly focusing on mechanical properties <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b2\">[3]</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b3\">[4]</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b4\">[5]</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b5\">[6]</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b6\">[7]</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b7\">[8]</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b8\">[9]</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b9\">[10]</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b10\">[11]</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b11\">[12]</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b12\">[13]</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b13\">[14]</ns0:ref>.

The mass transfers are thus at the heart of the feature of the food packaging, especially transfers of water vapor, oxygen and/or carbon dioxide, which condition the rates of numerous reactions of food degradation (oxidation, microbial development, physiological reactions, etc.). The development of bulk nanocomposite structures by introducing nanoparticles, i.e. fillers having at least one dimension lower than 100 nm, in polymeric matrices appeared as one of the most promising directions in the development of packaging materials with advanced mass transfer properties. The expected role of these inclusions is to achieve a significant decrease of the mass transfer properties as compared to the neat matrix by acting as physical obstacles to the diffusion and permeation of diffusing molecules, which have to follow a more tortuous pathway. This phenomenon is called the tortuosity effect.</ns0:p>', 2: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">Many types of nanoparticles have already been tested to modulate mass transfer properties, with hundreds of permeability data published in literature. Nanoparticles can be classified into three major categories according to their particle shape (Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">1</ns0:ref>): (i) isodimensional particles, that have the same size in all directions and an aspect ratio close to unity (such as spherical silica, TiO <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles, carbon black and fullerenes); (ii) elongated particles that consist in fibrils with a diameter ranging between 1 and 100 nm and length up to several hundred nanometers (such as carbon nanotubes or cellulose nanofibers); and (iii) layered particles that are characterized by one dimension ranging from several angstroms to several nanometers (such as layered silicates or starch nanocrystals). Among the three aforementioned types of particles, it is widely recognized that inclusion of impermeable platelets such as clays in the polymer should significantly enhance its barrier properties. However, an in-depth study of the available data in the literature revealed that it was not systematically the case and, even, on the contrary could lead to a deterioration of the barrier properties.

In-situ particle aspect ratio. The size aspect ratio of a nanoparticle is defined as the ratio of its longest dimension to its lowest dimension. Considering the different possible shapes of nanoparticles, it is obvious that the size aspect ratio of a sphere, equal to 1, is lower than that of elongated nanoparticles and nanoplatelets for which very high size aspect ratio could be achieved. The achievement of high size aspect ratios theoretically favors the establishment of a more tortuous pathway. This effect is all the greater for nanoplatelets that allow the creation of 2D obstacles. This has been experimentally validated by Gatos et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b29\">[30]</ns0:ref> who prepared by melt processing fully-exfoliated nanocomposites from a hydrogenated acrylonitrile butadiene rubber polymer and two layered silicates displaying different sizes, i.e. octadecylamine modified montmorillonites with a size aspect ratio of 100 and synthetic fluorohectorite with a size aspect ratio of 200. They observed that the highest decrease of oxygen permeability was achieved using the fluorohectorite as filler, which was ascribed to its higher aspect ratio <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b29\">[30]</ns0:ref>. It must be noted that the achievement of such high in-situ size aspect ratios is exceptional. Indeed, the formation of stacks or tactoïds within the polymer matrix is usually obtained due to the agglomeration and/or incomplete exfoliation of nanoplatelets, resulting in a decrease of the theoretical size aspect ratio. An intercalated nanocomposite structure is thus less tortuous than a full-exfoliated structure.

Well-oriented and aligned particles perpendicularly to the permeation flux have more impact on the decrease of the permeability than disoriented particles as regards the tortuosity effect. This effect of orientation is only valid for elongated particles and nanoplatelets and, of course, all the more significant for particles with high size aspect ratios. This effect of orientation is also theoretically much more efficient for nanoparticles displaying high size aspect ratio in two dimensions (such as platelets) than only in one dimension (such as elongated particles). In practice, it is an extremely challenging task to achieve a regular arrangement of nanoparticles within the polymer matrix. It is strongly dependent on processing methods. Solution intercalation and in-situ-polymerization are more prone to produce nanostructures with well-aligned and oriented particles than melt intercalation as observed by several authors.

In-situ particle aspect ratio. The size aspect ratio of a nanoparticle is defined as the ratio of its longest dimension to its lowest dimension. Considering the different possible shapes of nanoparticles, it is obvious that the size aspect ratio of a sphere, equal to 1, is lower than that of elongated nanoparticles and nanoplatelets for which very high size aspect ratio could be achieved. The achievement of high size aspect ratios theoretically favors the establishment of a more tortuous pathway. This effect is all the greater for nanoplatelets that allow the creation of 2D obstacles. This has been experimentally validated by Gatos et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b29\">[30]</ns0:ref> who prepared by melt processing fully-exfoliated nanocomposites from a hydrogenated acrylonitrile butadiene rubber polymer and two layered silicates displaying different sizes, i.e. octadecylamine modified montmorillonites with a size aspect ratio of 100 and synthetic fluorohectorite with a size aspect ratio of 200. They observed that the highest decrease of oxygen permeability was achieved using the fluorohectorite as filler, which was ascribed to its higher aspect ratio <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b29\">[30]</ns0:ref>. It must be noted that the achievement of such high in-situ size aspect ratios is exceptional. Indeed, the formation of stacks or tactoïds within the polymer matrix is usually obtained due to the agglomeration and/or incomplete exfoliation of nanoplatelets, resulting in a decrease of the theoretical size aspect ratio. An intercalated nanocomposite structure is thus less tortuous than a full-exfoliated structure. This implies that the in-situ size aspect ratio is usually different from the one of the native nanoparticle. As an example, Angellier-Coussy et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b30\">[31]</ns0:ref> found average values of in-situ size aspect ratio of 17 and 23 for 10.8 and 2.2 vol% of filler, respectively in wheat gluten/montmorillonite based nanocomposites while the size aspect ratio of one native nanoparticle was about 80.

Only Semsarzadeh et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b81\">[82]</ns0:ref> calculated the CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity in their study on polyurethane-silica/polyvinyl alcohol mixed matrix membranes.

They explained that, while O <sub>2</sub> , N <sub>2</sub> and CH <sub>4</sub> displayed decreasing permeability, CO <sub>2</sub> permeability demonstrated an increase upon increasing silica content due to an increase in the number of the active sites (polar OH groups) for gas dissolution in polymer matrix. The same reduced decrease in CO <sub>2</sub> permeability compared to other gases such as O <sub>2</sub> or N <sub>2</sub> was observed by Sadeghi et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b42\">[43,</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b80\">81]</ns0:ref> in polyether-based polyurethane-silica and polyurethane-silica nanocomposite leading to moderate increase of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> selectivity as a function of nanoparticle content (Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">7a</ns0:ref>).</ns0:p>', '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">The comparative examination of permeability and selectivity variation of data collected in the database considered in this work is now in order. Indeed, for the case of inclusion of impermeable particles in a permeable polymer matrix, the anticipated mechanism of induced tortuosity in path of gas molecules is expected to reduce the permeability of different gases by the same extent. A further analysis was thus performed to explore possible correlation between relative permeability and permselectivity in the available set of data. The examination is confined to the case of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> selectivity in nanocomposite obtained from the inclusion of isodimensional or platelet shaped nanoparticles, as only for those cases is a sufficient number of data available to insure the significance of the statistical analysis. In Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_9\">9</ns0:ref> the relative permeability for CO <sub>2</sub> in the nanocomposites is related to the corresponding square variation of permselectivity δ defined as follows:</ns0:p>', '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">where α <sub>NC</sub> and α <sub>M</sub> are CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity in nanocomposite and neat matrix, respectively. Despite the scattering, data in Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_9\">9</ns0:ref> put in evidence that, both for the case of isodimensional particles and platelets, relative permeability higher than one is typically accompanied by a significant deviation of nanocomposite permselectivity from the value of neat matrix, while an interval exists for relative permeability of nanocomposite moderately lower than 1, for which the deviation in permselectivity from the value of neat matrix is negligible. Significantly, the above interval for relative permeability extends to lower values for the case of nanocomposites including platelets with respect to the case of isodimensional particles. It can be thus concluded that a good number of studies considered in this work shows results which are at least qualitatively consistent with the picture resulting from the tortuosity effect induced by the dispersed phase to the motion of gas molecules. On the other hand, a large number of nanocomposites exhibiting either relative permeability values higher than one or very low seems to be often characterized by significant variation of the permselectivity, indicating the relevance of additional phenomena hiding the effect of a pure increase in tortuosity path for the motion of gas molecules in the system. As it can be seen in Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">8</ns0:ref>, data available to calculate H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity are much scarcer than for CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> and, for this reason, the correlation between relative permeability and deviation of permselectivity is not discussed here for this kind of data. No values were even found in the collected references for calculated H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity in iso-dimensional nanoparticle based nanocomposites. Only three references were found for elongated ones. O <sub>2</sub> permeability is rarely investigated concomitantly to H <sub>2</sub> O permeability although H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity is a very important value in many applications such as packaging where sometimes a high barrier property to O <sub>2</sub> is required at the same time as low barrier to H <sub>2</sub> 0. From Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">8</ns0:ref>, it can be concluded that the H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity did not vary so much as a function of nanoparticle volume fraction except for the study of Kasirga et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b73\">[74]</ns0:ref>, Chang et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b38\">[39]</ns0:ref> and Lee et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b47\">[48]</ns0:ref> where H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity tended to dramatically increase then decrease for at least Chang et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b38\">[39]</ns0:ref> and Lee et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b47\">[48]</ns0:ref>.

It is indeed of high interest in many applications to develop nanocomposites that are designed to provide a very strong barrier to one component (for instance oxygen) while remaining permeable to another (such as carbon dioxide or water vapor). In this purpose, CO <sub>2</sub> / O <sub>2</sub> selectivity and H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity were calculated, when possible, from the data gathered in the framework of this study and plotted as a function of the nanoparticle volume fraction (Figs. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">7 and 8</ns0:ref>). In most of cases, CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> and H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity was not initially in the objective of the original works used to derive it. Therefore, it was not systematically possible to calculate it from the permeability data available per reference. It must be noted that for the sake of clarity, for H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity, the ratio of nanocomposite selectivity to neat polymer selectivity is used in Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">8</ns0:ref> while absolute values of PCO <sub>2</sub> /PO <sub>2</sub> are directly plotted in Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">7</ns0:ref>, because they display less range of variation.</ns0:p>', 2: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">As it can be seen in Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">7</ns0:ref>, and in the logic of result of the Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_6\">3</ns0:ref> analysis, there are much more data of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity available for layered particles than for iso-dimensional particles and elongated ones where only four references have permitted to calculate this value. It is thus not possible to draw meaningful conclusions about the evolution of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity for elongated nanoparticles-based nanocomposites (Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">7b</ns0:ref>).</ns0:p>', 3: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">Logically, CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity of layered particles-based nanocomposites was centered around a mean value of 4, which is usually the permselectivity of oil-based polymers used as neat matrix in most of the studies (Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">7c</ns0:ref>).

In the same time and for another combination of filler/polymer (Nanofill 5 as MMT/PP), the data of Merinska et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b77\">[78]</ns0:ref> permitted to obtain a decrease of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity. Alena et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b79\">[80]</ns0:ref> also observed either an increase or decrease of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity depending on the type of nanoparticle (MMT) used in LDPE matrix. These last features confirm the random nature of the evolution of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity as a function of nanoparticle volume fraction.

The mass transfers are thus at the heart of the feature of the food packaging, especially transfers of water vapor, oxygen and/or carbon dioxide, which condition the rates of numerous reactions of food degradation (oxidation, microbial development, physiological reactions, etc.). The development of bulk nanocomposite structures by introducing nanoparticles, i.e. fillers having at least one dimension lower than 100 nm, in polymeric matrices appeared as one of the most promising directions in the development of packaging materials with advanced mass transfer properties. The expected role of these inclusions is to achieve a significant decrease of the mass transfer properties as compared to the neat matrix by acting as physical obstacles to the diffusion and permeation of diffusing molecules, which have to follow a more tortuous pathway. This phenomenon is called the tortuosity effect.</ns0:p>', 2: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">Many types of nanoparticles have already been tested to modulate mass transfer properties, with hundreds of permeability data published in literature. Nanoparticles can be classified into three major categories according to their particle shape (Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">1</ns0:ref>): (i) isodimensional particles, that have the same size in all directions and an aspect ratio close to unity (such as spherical silica, TiO <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles, carbon black and fullerenes); (ii) elongated particles that consist in fibrils with a diameter ranging between 1 and 100 nm and length up to several hundred nanometers (such as carbon nanotubes or cellulose nanofibers); and (iii) layered particles that are characterized by one dimension ranging from several angstroms to several nanometers (such as layered silicates or starch nanocrystals). Among the three aforementioned types of particles, it is widely recognized that inclusion of impermeable platelets such as clays in the polymer should significantly enhance its barrier properties. However, an in-depth study of the available data in the literature revealed that it was not systematically the case and, even, on the contrary could lead to a deterioration of the barrier properties.

However, the effect of the platelet-shape has never been compared and discussed along with results obtained with spherical and elongated particle shape. In spite of all these preceding reviews, there is still a huge lack of analysis of all available data in the perspective of deciphering the role of particle shape on the mass transfer properties of the resulting nanocomposite materials, even if it has been highlighted as a key input parameter in mathematical models. As far as we knew, there is no review that proposes an exhaustive analysis of the experimental permeability values from the available literature.</ns0:p>', 3: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">In order to better correlate the mass transfer properties in nanocomposite materials with their multi-scale structure, the objective of the present review is to decipher and comprehensively discuss the role of the nanoparticle shape (either isodimensional, elongated or layered) on the modulation of the mass transfer properties in nanocomposites, as a function of filler volume fraction and in the light of the nanocomposite structure achieved. For that purpose, more than 1000 values (i.e. about 170 articles) of the 1995-2015 period containing measured values of O <sub>2</sub> , CO <sub>2</sub> and H <sub>2</sub> O permeability in polymer-based nanocomposites were collected from the available literature and capitalized in a dedicated on-line database <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b19\">[20]</ns0:ref>. All data could be uploaded from the permalink provided in figure caption (https://doi.org/10.5281/ zenodo.1136269). The proposed on-line database consists in the first and unprecedented compilation of permeability values for nanocomposite based materials. The current work is focused on direct analysis and comparison of experiments, without any mediation which could be provided by quantitative models. It must be specified that, in order to build up the database for analysis, which is of interest here, recent data for gas barrier in polymer based materials with dispersed graphene and graphene derivatives were not taken into consideration. In fact, while the latter represent nanocomposite materials with dispersed layered domains, the extremely high aspect ratio and flexibility of graphene layers reduces the threshold value for percolation in these materials to much lower values than in traditional layered particles nanocomposites <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b20\">[21]</ns0:ref>. Under those conditions, in the volume concentration range for layered particles which is of reference in this work (in the order of 10% by volume) layers arrangement and layer defects are significantly more relevant to the barrier effect than the aspect ratio (particle shape) itself. For a comparison between gas barrier properties in polymer/clay and polymer/graphene nanocomposite see the review by Tan <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b21\">[22]</ns0:ref>. For the above reason, although graphene has attracted much attention in recent years for the production of polymer based composites for packaging, analysis of pertinent results for gas barrier properties is left to a different discussion and the interested reader is addressed to recent reviews in the field <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b22\">[23]</ns0:ref>.</ns0:p>', 4: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">Besides the meaningful conclusions on the role of nanoparticle shape, the main output of this paper is to give some recommendations for the design of nanocomposite packaging materials with tunable mass transfer properties.</ns0:p>'}], ['2', 'Brief overview of nanocomposites processing and morphologies', {1: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">All the processes used to prepare polymer-based nanocomposites have already been extensively detailed in dedicated reviews and are not further detailed here.

Due to the large range of polymer matrices and nanoparticles, different processing routes have been proposed to produce nanocomposites based on their convenience according to the nature of the raw constituents and their field of application (Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">2</ns0:ref>). At laboratory scale, four main processes are most commonly used to prepare polymer-based nanocomposites from all the types of nanoparticles. Melt processing and solution blending are two processes based on the use of polymers, which lead to the formation of Van der Waals interactions between the constituents, while insitu polymerization and sol/gel methods are based on the use of monomers or oligomers, leading to the formation of covalent bonds between the polymer and the nanoparticles (Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">2</ns0:ref>).

Similar analyses of the problem can be found in the field of electrical properties (electrical conductivity/permittivity) as well as in that of heat or mass transfer (thermal conductivity/mass diffusivity). Exact solutions in terms of effective conductivity of the composite medium have been obtained already by Maxwell in 1873 <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b25\">[26]</ns0:ref> for the case of dilute mixture of spherical domains (\"non-interacting particles\") perfectly adhering to the matrix. These exact solutions assume that the properties of dispersed and continuous phase in the composite are the same than the one measured in the corresponding pure materials (\"ideal interface condition\").</ns0:p>', 2: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">Wiener <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b26\">[27]</ns0:ref> in 1912 extended the results to the case of dilute dispersion of long cylinders in the matrix, all aligned in the direction normal to the overall flux. While exact solutions are also available for the case of spheroids (dilute mixture, perfect alignment), empirical relations as well as numerical result have been discussed for the case of different shapes of the inclusions. Among the best, known results of this kind are those obtained by Nielsen <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b27\">[28]</ns0:ref> in 1967 following empirical ideas about the increase in contour length of path of diffusing molecules in the composite medium due to the presence of impermeable inclusions in the form of bricks. The specific expression for effective conductivity as function of particle concentration in the composite as derived from the above models is not here presented and discussed, as the direct comparison of available experimental results with model predictions is not relevant to this work. On the other hand, it is useful to remember here that all the above approaches consistently predict a decrease in the conductivity when the concentration of impermeable particles in the composite increases. In general terms, it can be said that, assuming ideal interface and non-interacting particle condition, the effective conductivity of the composite medium is expected to be half the value of the pure matrix when the concentration of dispersed phase approaches 40% vol for isometric particles, 30% vol for elongated particles aligned normally to the flux, and a much lower value, only few percent, depending on the exact shape, for layered particles lying in planes orthogonal to the flux.</ns0:p>', 3: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">It should be finally mentioned that more complex analyses are definitely needed to consider the interaction between particles in the medium (concentrated mixtures), the distribution in their orientation, as well the non-ideal interaction with the matrix which can ultimately result in regions close to the interface with properties different from that of pure materials <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b28\">[29]</ns0:ref>.

The nanoparticles considered in works examined in this review are those assumed as impermeable and non-porous with respect to the application that is focused on: barrier membranes mainly for packaging application. Moreover, it must be noted that mass transfer does not follow the same mechanisms in dense and porous material and that mixing porous and non-porous materials may disturb the analysis. Only gases (O <sub>2</sub> and CO <sub>2</sub> ) and water vapor permeability data were considered because of their high interest for food packaging applications. These data were analyzed as regard to the particle shape (isodimensional, elongated, or platelet), the filler volume fraction, the eventual chemical and functionalization treatments applied to the nanoparticle and the elaboration technique used to prepare materials.

Papers dealing with elongated particle displaying micrometric sizes (13 papers more) were voluntary excluded from this review.

In-situ particle aspect ratio. The size aspect ratio of a nanoparticle is defined as the ratio of its longest dimension to its lowest dimension. Considering the different possible shapes of nanoparticles, it is obvious that the size aspect ratio of a sphere, equal to 1, is lower than that of elongated nanoparticles and nanoplatelets for which very high size aspect ratio could be achieved. The achievement of high size aspect ratios theoretically favors the establishment of a more tortuous pathway. This effect is all the greater for nanoplatelets that allow the creation of 2D obstacles. This has been experimentally validated by Gatos et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b29\">[30]</ns0:ref> who prepared by melt processing fully-exfoliated nanocomposites from a hydrogenated acrylonitrile butadiene rubber polymer and two layered silicates displaying different sizes, i.e. octadecylamine modified montmorillonites with a size aspect ratio of 100 and synthetic fluorohectorite with a size aspect ratio of 200. They observed that the highest decrease of oxygen permeability was achieved using the fluorohectorite as filler, which was ascribed to its higher aspect ratio <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b29\">[30]</ns0:ref>. It must be noted that the achievement of such high in-situ size aspect ratios is exceptional. Indeed, the formation of stacks or tactoïds within the polymer matrix is usually obtained due to the agglomeration and/or incomplete exfoliation of nanoplatelets, resulting in a decrease of the theoretical size aspect ratio. An intercalated nanocomposite structure is thus less tortuous than a full-exfoliated structure. This implies that the in-situ size aspect ratio is usually different from the one of the native nanoparticle. As an example, Angellier-Coussy et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b30\">[31]</ns0:ref> found average values of in-situ size aspect ratio of 17 and 23 for 10.8 and 2.2 vol% of filler, respectively in wheat gluten/montmorillonite based nanocomposites while the size aspect ratio of one native nanoparticle was about 80. This issue is the same for elongated nanoparticles where agglomeration often occurs.</ns0:p>', 5: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">In practice, the knowledge of the in-situ size aspect ratio is thus necessary to fully understand and predict the impact of tortuosity on mass transfer properties. It is usually evaluated using image analysis of TEM pictures when nanoparticles can be easily distinguished from the matrix as is the case for montmorillonite <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b30\">[31]</ns0:ref>. This analysis is tricky and time consuming. Indeed, a large number of images must be analyzed to obtain a significant representativeness of the whole material. In addition, it is well-known that TEM analysis has some inherent limitations due to the fact that it projects three-dimensional (3D) objects onto a two-dimensional (2D) plane, resulting in TEM cross-sections that do not necessarily represent the actual size of all the platelets <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b31\">[32]</ns0:ref>. Furthermore, an ideal image would exhibit sharp transitions from black to white, what is not the case in reality, necessitating the conversion of the original grey-scale TEM micrograph into a black and white image using a semi-automated approach, this step being inevitably accompanied by errors. And finally, this evaluation must be done for each filler content, since the dispersion state strongly depends on the filler content. All these limitations probably explain why the evaluation of the in-situ size aspect ratio is rarely experimentally determined. It is usually an imprecise, unrealistic (if the size aspect ratio of the native nanoparticle is considered) or missing data.</ns0:p>', 6: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">4.1.1.2. In-situ size aspect ratio and dispersion state. As explained above, the in-situ aspect ratio strongly depends on the particle dispersion state. Contrary to the in-situ size aspect ratio, which is rarely determined, the impact of the particle dispersion state on nanocomposite mass transfer properties has been largely demonstrated. For example, Koh et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b32\">[33]</ns0:ref> demonstrated with PLA/organo-modified montmorillonites nanocomposites that the highest decrease of the oxygen and carbon dioxide permeability was obtained for the most exfoliated structure. The same positive impact of exfoliation on permeability decrease was also obtained by Sanchez-Garcia et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b33\">[34]</ns0:ref> in PHBV-PCL nanocomposites and by Sun et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b34\">[35]</ns0:ref> for α-zirconium phosphate/ epoxy resin nanocomposites.</ns0:p>', 7: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">It is worth noting that the achievement of a good dispersion state is all the more difficult as the filler content increases due to agglomeration phenomena, as evidenced in many systems such as agar-(Rhim et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b35\">[36]</ns0:ref>), polyester-(Bharadwaj et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b36\">[37]</ns0:ref>), polyamide-(Picard et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b37\">[38]</ns0:ref>) or polyimide-(Chang et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b38\">[39]</ns0:ref>) based nanocomposites with montmorillonite as nanoparticles. Chemical modification of nanoparticles does not always prevent agglomeration, as evidenced by Zhu et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b39\">[40]</ns0:ref> with modified SiO <sub>2</sub> particles in poly (vinyl chloride) matrix.</ns0:p>', 8: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">4.1.1.3. Orientation. To obtain an optimal decreasing effect on permeability, the largest surface of each nanoparticle must be oriented perpendicular to the direction of the gas diffusion or permeation. Well-oriented and aligned particles perpendicularly to the permeation flux have more impact on the decrease of the permeability than disoriented particles as regards the tortuosity effect. This effect of orientation is only valid for elongated particles and nanoplatelets and, of course, all the more significant for particles with high size aspect ratios. This effect of orientation is also theoretically much more efficient for nanoparticles displaying high size aspect ratio in two dimensions (such as platelets) than only in one dimension (such as elongated particles). In practice, it is an extremely challenging task to achieve a regular arrangement of nanoparticles within the polymer matrix. It is strongly dependent on processing methods. Solution intercalation and in-situ-polymerization are more prone to produce nanostructures with well-aligned and oriented particles than melt intercalation as observed by several authors. It is all the more difficult that particles display high aspect ratio in 2dimension such as platelets. For example, Messersmith et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b40\">[41]</ns0:ref> showed that montmorillonites adopted a planar orientation in the poly (ε-caprolactone) polymer matrix after in-situ-polymerization and solution casting processing while Sanchez-Garcia et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b41\">[42]</ns0:ref> noted that it was difficult to obtain, using melt processing and compression moulding, well aligned and oriented montmorillonites in PHBV-PCL polymer and that a random orientation is at best the most often achieved.</ns0:p>'}], ['4.1.2', 'Modification of the polymer matrix', {1: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">The incorporation of nanoparticles can modify the structure and thus the mass transfer properties of the polymer matrix itself. The two main structural modifications reported to contribute to the decrease of P/P <sub>0</sub> are (i) a reduction of polymer free volume associated to an increase in the glass transition temperature and/or (ii) an increase in crystallinity due to a nucleating effect of nanoparticles. The effect of polymer free volume was for example evidenced in the study of Sadeghi et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b42\">[43]</ns0:ref> by a reduction of the polymer chain mobility in the amorphous phase in the case of polyurethane-silica nanocomposites. The impact of nanoparticles on polymer crystallinity was largely reported for either spherical particles such as silica nanoparticles (Vladimirov et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b43\">[44]</ns0:ref>; Vassiliou et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b44\">[45]</ns0:ref>) or layered particles such as montmorillonite (Sanchez-Garcia et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b41\">[42]</ns0:ref>; Ghasemi et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b45\">[46]</ns0:ref>). Crystallites act as obstacles to migrant diffusion.</ns0:p>'}], ['4.1.3', 'Decrease of polymer sorption sites', {1: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">The chemical modification of the nanoparticle surface is generally performed to reach a better filler/matrix affinity and thus a better dispersion of nanofillers within the polymer matrix. A side effect of this higher affinity is a decrease of the availability of the sorption sites in the polymer. It is particularly true for highly interactive molecules such as water vapor that interacts though hydrogen bonding with hydrophilic sites. These sites bonded with the nanoparticles are not any more available for water sorption. Such changes in specific interactions between the migrant and the polymer were proposed to explain the decrease of water vapor permeability observed by Tunc et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b46\">[47]</ns0:ref> in wheat gluten/montmorillonite or by Lee et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b47\">[48]</ns0:ref> in soy protein/ montmorillonite nanocomposites.</ns0:p>'}], ['4.2', 'Monotonic increase of the permeability', {1: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">Several assumptions are proposed in literature to explain either the absence of significant modification or even an increase of the permeability in nanocomposites: (1) an insufficient tortuosity effect, (2) the occurrence of macroscopic structural defects in the nanocomposite material induced for instance by particles agglomeration, (3) a significant modification of the structure of the polymer matrix such as a decrease of crystallinity or molecular weight, and (4) an increase of migrant sorption induced by nanoparticles (case of water vapor for example, for water sensitive materials). It is worth noting that some mechanisms assumed to explain an increase of P/P <sub>0</sub> were previously discussed for explaining a decrease of P/P <sub>0</sub> (Section 3.1).</ns0:p>'}], ['4.2.1', 'Lack of tortuosity effect', {1: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">In some cases, the dispersion state of nanoparticles did not allow to achieve a sufficient tortuosity effect to slow down the diffusion of migrating molecules, especially for small molecules such as gases. Such an explanation is widely proposed to explain why values of permeability did not change or only slightly decreased in the nanocomposite as compared to the neat matrix. This has been, for example, proposed by Tunc et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b46\">[47]</ns0:ref> to explain the constancy of O <sub>2</sub> permeability in wheat gluten/montmorillonite nanocomposites. In the same article, authors however demonstrated that the achieved tortuosity was nevertheless sufficient for decreasing permeability of bigger molecules such as aroma compounds. This highlighted that the nature, molecular weight and/or steric hindrance of the migrant are also key parameters governing the mass transfer properties in nanocomposites. 4.2.2. Macroscopic structural defects 4.2.2.1. Particle agglomeration. The presence of both nano-or microsized agglomerates and aggregates of particles could induce macroscopic structural defects, which play a major role in the increase of P/P <sub>0</sub> , as already shown for either spherical-based composites with SiO <sub>2</sub> (Cornelius et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b48\">[49]</ns0:ref>), TiO <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (Zoppi et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b49\">[50]</ns0:ref>) or cylinder-based composites with cellulose fibrils (Bilbao-Sainz et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b50\">[51]</ns0:ref>). These agglomeration phenomena are related to a bad dispersion of the nanoparticles which is mainly ascribed to (1) mismatching of the particle polarity, as compared to that of the polymer, resulting in a low affinity between constituents and thus a poor particle/polymer adhesion <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b49\">[50]</ns0:ref> and/or (2) inefficiency of the elaboration technique to separate aggregates.</ns0:p>', 2: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">For example, insufficient shearing forces during the melt processing could cause agglomeration of particles. During casting, sol-gel method and in-situ polymerization, coalescence of the particles during drying of the solution could appear through insufficient particle/particle interactions (\"bad compatibility\"). This last phenomenon is normally limited by chemical modification of the surface of the particles. But when the effect of this chemical modification is wrongly anticipated it could even amplify/trigger coalescence of particles as evidenced by Zhu et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b39\">[40]</ns0:ref> in their study of H <sub>2</sub> 0 and O <sub>2</sub> permeability of silica/PVC nanocomposites with SiO <sub>2</sub> surface grafted with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). They noticed that high content of filling (&gt; 2.5 vol/vol%) increased the permeability of both O <sub>2</sub> and H <sub>2</sub> 0 due to an agglomeration phenomenon owing to the tendency of nanoscale silica modified nanoparticles to be fused together at this concentration. This phenomenon was not anticipated.</ns0:p>', 3: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">Agglomeration could lead to the formation of \"interfacial voids\" at the particle/polymer matrix interface and to the formation of a preferential pathway for the migration of the molecular penetrant (Ismail et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b51\">[52]</ns0:ref>, Rafiq et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b52\">[53]</ns0:ref>). This is further detailed below in the section dedicated to the \"interphase\". 4.2.2.2. Interphase. An interphase, i.e. a \"third compartment\" with its own properties, is generated at the particles/polymer interface due to the establishment of either weak or strong interfacial interactions between the particles and the polymer matrix. Depending on its nature and thickness (or volume fraction), the interphase could significantly participate to the overall mass transfer properties and strongly influence the overall permeability of the composite as evidenced by Liang et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b53\">[54]</ns0:ref> in their poly(ethersulfone)/ montmorillonite nanocomposites. These authors hypothesized that the interphase in their nanocomposite structure was made of interface voids due to a poor adhesion between hydrophilic nanoparticles and hydrophobic polymers contributing to the high gas permeability observed.</ns0:p>'}], ['4.2.3', 'Modification of the polymer matrix', {1: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">The incorporation of nanoparticles could result in the disruption of polymer chain packing, causing an increase of polymer matrix free volume. This increase in free volume leads to an increase in permeability or to a lesser decrease than expected. This impact on free volume is often just a hypothesis that is not always confirmed experimentally, due to the difficulty to experimentally access such information.</ns0:p>', 2: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">Such hypothesis of polymer matrix modification with increase of free volume was speculated by several authors for isodimensional particles-based composites with titanium dioxide (Matteucci et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b54\">[55]</ns0:ref>, Moghadam et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b55\">[56]</ns0:ref>) or silica nanoparticles (Dougnac et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b56\">[57]</ns0:ref>, Romero et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b57\">[58]</ns0:ref>) and in elongated particles-based nanocomposites with carbon nanotube (Murali et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b58\">[59]</ns0:ref>). An increase of free volume was also hypothesized to occur when using compatibilizing agents due to bad compatibility between the compatibilizer and the surface treated particles (Mittal et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b59\">[60]</ns0:ref>). The addition of nanoparticles in a polymer matrix could also hinder the crystallization process if chain mobility is hindered, leading thus to a decrease of the overall crystallinity of the polymer that could contribute to enhance the overall mass transfer within the composite (Dougnac et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b56\">[57]</ns0:ref>).</ns0:p>', 3: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">We noted that this increase of free volume is often considered as a global explanation resulting from different phenomena: in addition to the modification of polymer matrix, increase in free volume could also result in void space formation by nanoparticles aggregation and weak interaction between polymer-nanoparticles at interface (Moghadam et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b55\">[56]</ns0:ref>). All these mechanisms are not easily distinguished. Therefore, authors stressed an overall increase of free volume that they experimentally assessed by density measurements, without distinguishing all underlying mechanisms. Indeed, if the density of the nanoparticles, crystalline polymer and amorphous polymer phases has their pure component values in the nanocomposites, then the density of a nanocomposite sample, would be equal to the theoretical additive density. The difference between theoretical and experimental densities can be rationalized by the overall increase of free volume as evidenced by (Matteucci et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b54\">[55]</ns0:ref>) in spherical-based composites with titanium dioxide.</ns0:p>'}], ['4.2.4', 'Increasing migrant sorption', {1: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">The increase of P/P <sub>0</sub> could be related to the establishment of specific interactions between the molecular penetrant and the material constituents, as largely observed for water vapor and hygroscopic nanoparticles such as silica nanoparticles (Bracho et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b60\">[61]</ns0:ref>, Dougnac et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b56\">[57]</ns0:ref>) or microcrystalline cellulose (Dogan et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b61\">[62]</ns0:ref>), and also for O <sub>2</sub> and organo-modified montmorillonite (Chang et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b62\">[63]</ns0:ref>), for O <sub>2</sub> or modified silica nanoparticles (Iwata et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b63\">[64]</ns0:ref>) or CO <sub>2</sub> and titanium dioxide nanoparticles (Matteucci et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b54\">[55]</ns0:ref>).</ns0:p>', 2: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">Different mechanisms could occur concomitantly, explaining why significant effects on P/P <sub>0</sub> are not systematically observed.

The same happened in the study of Matteucci et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b54\">[55]</ns0:ref>: they observed an enhancement of CO <sub>2</sub> permeability in spherical-based composites with titanium dioxide due to an increase in gas solubility in the nanocomposite films upon incorporation of highly sorbing nanoparticles into the polymer.

It must be noted that for the sake of clarity, for H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity, the ratio of nanocomposite selectivity to neat polymer selectivity is used in Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">8</ns0:ref> while absolute values of PCO <sub>2</sub> /PO <sub>2</sub> are directly plotted in Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">7</ns0:ref>, because they display less range of variation.</ns0:p>', 2: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">As it can be seen in Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">7</ns0:ref>, and in the logic of result of the Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_6\">3</ns0:ref> analysis, there are much more data of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity available for layered particles than for iso-dimensional particles and elongated ones where only four references have permitted to calculate this value.

In the work of Meera et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b78\">[79]</ns0:ref>, the decrease of permeability as a function of filler content is much higher for O <sub>2</sub> than for CO <sub>2</sub> leading to an increase of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permeability ratio while it seems to be the contrary for Merinska et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b77\">[78]</ns0:ref>. In the same time and for another combination of filler/polymer (Nanofill 5 as MMT/PP), the data of Merinska et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b77\">[78]</ns0:ref> permitted to obtain a decrease of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity. Alena et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b79\">[80]</ns0:ref> also observed either an increase or decrease of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity depending on the type of nanoparticle (MMT) used in LDPE matrix. These last features confirm the random nature of the evolution of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity as a function of nanoparticle volume fraction. We noted that this notion of permselectivity and its evolution as a function of filler content was never explained nor even highlighted by the aforementioned group of authors.</ns0:p>', 4: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">For isodimensional particles-based nanocomposites, the CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity is also centered around a value of 5 (Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">7a</ns0:ref>) and kept almost constant as a function of filler volume fraction. Nevertheless, a group of 5 studies displays very high CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity (&gt; 15). Among this group of studies, we noted a general trend toward an increase of permselectivity with nanoparticle volume fraction (4 studies <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b42\">[43,</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b69\">70,</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b80\">81,</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b81\">82]</ns0:ref> observing an increase against only one <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b49\">[50]</ns0:ref> observing a decrease). Variation of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity in the aforementioned studies was principally due to the fact that O <sub>2</sub> and CO <sub>2</sub> permeability did not decrease as much as a function of filler content resulting in a nonconstant PCO <sub>2</sub> /PO <sub>2</sub> ratio. Results of Zoppi et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b49\">[50]</ns0:ref> and Kim et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b69\">[70]</ns0:ref> with high CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity were obtained on PEBAX® (copolymer with polyamide-6 and poly(ethyleneoxide)) which is known to display high CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> selectivity in packaging application. These authors did not try to explain why the CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity varied in their sample: Kim et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b69\">[70]</ns0:ref> focused only on CO <sub>2</sub> /He, CO <sub>2</sub> /N <sub>2</sub> and O <sub>2</sub> /N <sub>2</sub> selectivity and did not notice any variation of these selectivities as a function of nanoparticle volume fraction (about 6 for CO <sub>2</sub> /He, 70 for CO <sub>2</sub> /N <sub>2</sub> and 3 for O <sub>2</sub> /N <sub>2</sub> respectively); Zoppi et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b49\">[50]</ns0:ref> focusing on O <sub>2</sub> / N <sub>2</sub> , CO <sub>2</sub> /CH <sub>4</sub> , CO <sub>2</sub> /N <sub>2</sub> and CO <sub>2</sub> /H <sub>2</sub> selectivity did not notice so much variation of this value as a function of nanoparticle content except for very high volume ratio (15 vol/vol%). Only Semsarzadeh et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b81\">[82]</ns0:ref> calculated the CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity in their study on polyurethane-silica/polyvinyl alcohol mixed matrix membranes. They noticed that by increasing the silica content in membranes, all gas permselectivities including CO <sub>2</sub> , namely CO <sub>2</sub> /N <sub>2</sub> , CO <sub>2</sub> /CH <sub>4</sub> and CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> increased much more than selectivity including other gases such as O <sub>2</sub> / N <sub>2</sub> , up to 136%, 69% and 47%, respectively. They explained that, while O <sub>2</sub> , N <sub>2</sub> and CH <sub>4</sub> displayed decreasing permeability, CO <sub>2</sub> permeability demonstrated an increase upon increasing silica content due to an increase in the number of the active sites (polar OH groups) for gas dissolution in polymer matrix. The same reduced decrease in CO <sub>2</sub> permeability compared to other gases such as O <sub>2</sub> or N <sub>2</sub> was observed by Sadeghi et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b42\">[43,</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b80\">81]</ns0:ref> in polyether-based polyurethane-silica and polyurethane-silica nanocomposite leading to moderate increase of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> selectivity as a function of nanoparticle content (Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">7a</ns0:ref>).</ns0:p>', 5: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">The comparative examination of permeability and selectivity variation of data collected in the database considered in this work is now in order. Indeed, for the case of inclusion of impermeable particles in a permeable polymer matrix, the anticipated mechanism of induced tortuosity in path of gas molecules is expected to reduce the permeability of different gases by the same extent. A further analysis was thus performed to explore possible correlation between relative permeability and permselectivity in the available set of data. The examination is confined to the case of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> selectivity in nanocomposite obtained from the inclusion of isodimensional or platelet shaped nanoparticles, as only for those cases is a sufficient number of data available to insure the significance of the statistical analysis. In Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_9\">9</ns0:ref> the relative permeability for CO <sub>2</sub> in the nanocomposites is related to the corresponding square variation of permselectivity δ defined as follows:</ns0:p>', 6: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">where α <sub>NC</sub> and α <sub>M</sub> are CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity in nanocomposite and neat matrix, respectively. Despite the scattering, data in Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_9\">9</ns0:ref> put in evidence that, both for the case of isodimensional particles and platelets, relative permeability higher than one is typically accompanied by a significant deviation of nanocomposite permselectivity from the value of neat matrix, while an interval exists for relative permeability of nanocomposite moderately lower than 1, for which the deviation in permselectivity from the value of neat matrix is negligible. Significantly, the above interval for relative permeability extends to lower values for the case of nanocomposites including platelets with respect to the case of isodimensional particles. It can be thus concluded that a good number of studies considered in this work shows results which are at least qualitatively consistent with the picture resulting from the tortuosity effect induced by the dispersed phase to the motion of gas molecules. On the other hand, a large number of nanocomposites exhibiting either relative permeability values higher than one or very low seems to be often characterized by significant variation of the permselectivity, indicating the relevance of additional phenomena hiding the effect of a pure increase in tortuosity path for the motion of gas molecules in the system. As it can be seen in Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">8</ns0:ref>, data available to calculate H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity are much scarcer than for CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> and, for this reason, the correlation between relative permeability and deviation of permselectivity is not discussed here for this kind of data. No values were even found in the collected references for calculated H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity in iso-dimensional nanoparticle based nanocomposites. Only three references were found for elongated ones. O <sub>2</sub> permeability is rarely investigated concomitantly to H <sub>2</sub> O permeability although H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity is a very important value in many applications such as packaging where sometimes a high barrier property to O <sub>2</sub> is required at the same time as low barrier to H <sub>2</sub> 0. From Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">8</ns0:ref>, it can be concluded that the H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity did not vary so much as a function of nanoparticle volume fraction except for the study of Kasirga et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b73\">[74]</ns0:ref>, Chang et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b38\">[39]</ns0:ref> and Lee et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b47\">[48]</ns0:ref> where H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity tended to dramatically increase then decrease for at least Chang et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b38\">[39]</ns0:ref> and Lee et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b47\">[48]</ns0:ref>. Even if none of these authors intentionally measured nor explained the evolution of H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity, this behavior could be generally ascribed to a better tortuosity effect obtained for H <sub>2</sub> O than for O <sub>2</sub> and, for non-monotonic behavior, to nonlinear decrease in permeability with clay loading.</ns0:p>', 7: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">To conclude about the selective transport characteristics of nanocomposites membranes, the previous analysis has highlighted that a correlation exists between permeability and the corresponding selectivity value which could be used to emphasize that deviations from expected behavior for selectivity (either positive or negative variation of selectivity) are often associated with deviations from expected behavior for permeability (very high reduction or increase).</ns0:p>'}], ['5', 'Conclusion', {1: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">The recently-measured values of gas (O <sub>2</sub> , CO <sub>2</sub> ) and water vapor permeability in agro-, bio-and synthetic-based nanocomposites have been comprehensively reviewed with emphases on the link between their micro-and nano-structure and their barrier performance.</ns0:p>', 2: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">This review has revealed that despite numerous and intensive studies on the optimization of nanocomposite processing and structure in the perspective of modulating their barrier properties, the expected decreasing effect on the permeability is often not so high as expected and sometimes completely the opposite. This review confirmed that layered nanoparticles are more efficient than isodimensional and elongated nanoparticles to decrease the relative permeability (P/P <sub>0</sub> ). But, this effect is difficult to anticipate due to numerous interfering mechanisms that provoke modifications of tortuosity, sorption, polymer matrix (crystallinity, free volume, molar mass), creation of an interphase, voids and cracks, and more that lead to unexpected behaviors of the permeability in nanocomposites. Investigation of the selective transport of CO <sub>2</sub> to O <sub>2</sub> and H <sub>2</sub> 0 to O <sub>2</sub> did not reveal a general trend either and it is also difficult to anticipate.</ns0:p>', 3: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">It was concluded that tortuosity, the main mechanism proposed to explain permeability decrease in nanocomposites, often fails in explaining the effect of nanoparticles on nanocomposite barrier properties. This is particularly important knowing that most of the mathematical models used to predict permeability in nanocomposites are based on this tortuosity effect.</ns0:p>'}]]\n"

It is well known that inclusion of homogeneously dispersed and oriented impermeable fillers with high aspect ratio, such as platelets or elongated particles, should significantly increase the diffusion path of gas and vapors and yield to improve barrier properties. Results revealed that this expected impact was not systematically achieved, even for impermeable lamellar fillers that usually displayed the highest aspect ratio. More specifically, an unexpected increase of the permeability in the nanocomposite was often observed. To explain this deviation of the \\'ideal behavior\\', this paper discusses extensively the impact of the nanoparticle shape on the nanocomposite permeability along with structural aspects, related to both the particle nature and size, and the nanocomposite processing routes. Deviations from expected results of enhanced barrier effect are also discussed in correlation with unexpected variations in gas selectivity for O 2 /CO 2 pair. Lastly, this review aims at drawing meaningful conclusions on the structure/mass transfer relationships and giving directions for the development of the next generation of packaging materials with tailored mass transfer properties.</ns0:p>'}], ['1', 'Introduction', {1: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">In the objective of developing efficient and optimal packaging, one of the main challenges is to design and provide food packaging materials able to protect the food from the external environment and to maintain food quality and safety throughout its shelf life <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b0\">[1,</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b1\">2]</ns0:ref>. The mass transfers are thus at the heart of the feature of the food packaging, especially transfers of water vapor, oxygen and/or carbon dioxide, which condition the rates of numerous reactions of food degradation (oxidation, microbial development, physiological reactions, etc.). The development of bulk nanocomposite structures by introducing nanoparticles, i.e. fillers having at least one dimension lower than 100 nm, in polymeric matrices appeared as one of the most promising directions in the development of packaging materials with advanced mass transfer properties. The expected role of these inclusions is to achieve a significant decrease of the mass transfer properties as compared to the neat matrix by acting as physical obstacles to the diffusion and permeation of diffusing molecules, which have to follow a more tortuous pathway. This phenomenon is called the tortuosity effect.</ns0:p>', 2: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">Many types of nanoparticles have already been tested to modulate mass transfer properties, with hundreds of permeability data published in literature. Nanoparticles can be classified into three major categories according to their particle shape (Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">1</ns0:ref>): (i) isodimensional particles, that have the same size in all directions and an aspect ratio close to unity (such as spherical silica, TiO <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles, carbon black and fullerenes); (ii) elongated particles that consist in fibrils with a diameter ranging between 1 and 100 nm and length up to several hundred nanometers (such as carbon nanotubes or cellulose nanofibers); and (iii) layered particles that are characterized by one dimension ranging from several angstroms to several nanometers (such as layered silicates or starch nanocrystals). Among the three aforementioned types of particles, it is widely recognized that inclusion of impermeable platelets such as clays in the polymer should significantly enhance its barrier properties. However, an in-depth study of the available data in the literature revealed that it was not systematically the case and, even, on the contrary could lead to a deterioration of the barrier properties. Many reviews deal with the functional properties of nanocomposites, by mainly focusing on mechanical properties <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b2\">[3]</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b3\">[4]</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b4\">[5]</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b5\">[6]</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b6\">[7]</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b7\">[8]</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b8\">[9]</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b9\">[10]</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b10\">[11]</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b11\">[12]</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b12\">[13]</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b13\">[14]</ns0:ref>.

However, the effect of the platelet-shape has never been compared and discussed along with results obtained with spherical and elongated particle shape. In spite of all these preceding reviews, there is still a huge lack of analysis of all available data in the perspective of deciphering the role of particle shape on the mass transfer properties of the resulting nanocomposite materials, even if it has been highlighted as a key input parameter in mathematical models.

For that purpose, more than 1000 values (i.e. about 170 articles) of the 1995-2015 period containing measured values of O <sub>2</sub> , CO <sub>2</sub> and H <sub>2</sub> O permeability in polymer-based nanocomposites were collected from the available literature and capitalized in a dedicated on-line database <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b19\">[20]</ns0:ref>.

The proposed on-line database consists in the first and unprecedented compilation of permeability values for nanocomposite based materials. The current work is focused on direct analysis and comparison of experiments, without any mediation which could be provided by quantitative models. It must be specified that, in order to build up the database for analysis, which is of interest here, recent data for gas barrier in polymer based materials with dispersed graphene and graphene derivatives were not taken into consideration. In fact, while the latter represent nanocomposite materials with dispersed layered domains, the extremely high aspect ratio and flexibility of graphene layers reduces the threshold value for percolation in these materials to much lower values than in traditional layered particles nanocomposites <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b20\">[21]</ns0:ref>. Under those conditions, in the volume concentration range for layered particles which is of reference in this work (in the order of 10% by volume) layers arrangement and layer defects are significantly more relevant to the barrier effect than the aspect ratio (particle shape) itself.

Due to the large range of polymer matrices and nanoparticles, different processing routes have been proposed to produce nanocomposites based on their convenience according to the nature of the raw constituents and their field of application (Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">2</ns0:ref>). At laboratory scale, four main processes are most commonly used to prepare polymer-based nanocomposites from all the types of nanoparticles. Melt processing and solution blending are two processes based on the use of polymers, which lead to the formation of Van der Waals interactions between the constituents, while insitu polymerization and sol/gel methods are based on the use of monomers or oligomers, leading to the formation of covalent bonds between the polymer and the nanoparticles (Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">2</ns0:ref>).

Similar analyses of the problem can be found in the field of electrical properties (electrical conductivity/permittivity) as well as in that of heat or mass transfer (thermal conductivity/mass diffusivity). Exact solutions in terms of effective conductivity of the composite medium have been obtained already by Maxwell in 1873 <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b25\">[26]</ns0:ref> for the case of dilute mixture of spherical domains (\"non-interacting particles\") perfectly adhering to the matrix.

While exact solutions are also available for the case of spheroids (dilute mixture, perfect alignment), empirical relations as well as numerical result have been discussed for the case of different shapes of the inclusions. Among the best, known results of this kind are those obtained by Nielsen <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b27\">[28]</ns0:ref> in 1967 following empirical ideas about the increase in contour length of path of diffusing molecules in the composite medium due to the presence of impermeable inclusions in the form of bricks. The specific expression for effective conductivity as function of particle concentration in the composite as derived from the above models is not here presented and discussed, as the direct comparison of available experimental results with model predictions is not relevant to this work. On the other hand, it is useful to remember here that all the above approaches consistently predict a decrease in the conductivity when the concentration of impermeable particles in the composite increases. In general terms, it can be said that, assuming ideal interface and non-interacting particle condition, the effective conductivity of the composite medium is expected to be half the value of the pure matrix when the concentration of dispersed phase approaches 40% vol for isometric particles, 30% vol for elongated particles aligned normally to the flux, and a much lower value, only few percent, depending on the exact shape, for layered particles lying in planes orthogonal to the flux.</ns0:p>', 3: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">It should be finally mentioned that more complex analyses are definitely needed to consider the interaction between particles in the medium (concentrated mixtures), the distribution in their orientation, as well the non-ideal interaction with the matrix which can ultimately result in regions close to the interface with properties different from that of pure materials <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b28\">[29]</ns0:ref>.

The nanoparticles considered in works examined in this review are those assumed as impermeable and non-porous with respect to the application that is focused on: barrier membranes mainly for packaging application. Moreover, it must be noted that mass transfer does not follow the same mechanisms in dense and porous material and that mixing porous and non-porous materials may disturb the analysis. Only gases (O <sub>2</sub> and CO <sub>2</sub> ) and water vapor permeability data were considered because of their high interest for food packaging applications. These data were analyzed as regard to the particle shape (isodimensional, elongated, or platelet), the filler volume fraction, the eventual chemical and functionalization treatments applied to the nanoparticle and the elaboration technique used to prepare materials.

For elongated nanoparticles, the same increase of P/P <sub>0</sub> is obtained but only for filler contents lower than 20 vol%. For higher filler contents, no clear tendency is evidenced, with a disordered shape of the curve. This could be due to agglomerated or percolated structures that become frequent for such high concentration in fillers whose effect on permeability is more unpredictable (Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_8\">5b</ns0:ref>). Finally, for nanoplatelets-based nanocomposites, for filler contents lower than 5 vol%, the evolution of P/P <sub>0</sub> is the same as the general one previously observed on Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_7\">4</ns0:ref> and is characterized by a main peak (30% of data) centered on the class 0.6-0.8. This main peak shifts to lower P/P <sub>0</sub> values, i.e. better efficiency, for filler contents ranging from 5 to 10 vol%, with a main peak (38%) for P/P <sub>0</sub> values in the range of 0.4-0.6. For filler content higher than 10 vol%, the decrease in permeability is not confirmed anymore. We noted that studies conducted with such high amounts of platelets (&gt; 10 vol%) were scarce, which makes it difficult to generalize the effect of high contents of platelets on the permeability of resulting nanocomposites (Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_8\">5c</ns0:ref>).</ns0:p>', 6: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">To sum up, beyond the fact that modulation of the permeability is clearly affected by the shape of the nanoparticles, three conclusions (i) whatever the filler content, the addition of isodimensional particles does not statistically impact the permeability of resulting nanocomposites very much, (ii) a significant decrease of permeability could be achieved by nanostructuring polymer matrices with the introduction of either elongated or nanoplatelets-shaped nanoparticles, with a much higher efficiency of layered nanoparticles. Indeed, the use of filler contents higher than 20 vol% are necessary to achieve a significant decrease of P/P <sub>0</sub> in the case of elongated nanoparticles while less than 10 vol% are sufficient in the case of nanoplatelets, (iii) the barrier effect of nanoplatelets is even more pronounced for filler contents ranging from 5 to 10 vol%.</ns0:p>', 7: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">This analysis has also revealed that the behavior of P/P <sub>0</sub> is more complex than expected, with the occurrence of non-monotonic behaviors, especially in the case of elongated nanoparticles.

For the sake of clarity, the exhaustive list of these references is in footnote. <super>1</super> The amplitude of this decrease largely depends on the particle shape and/or particle volume fraction used. The authors mainly attributed this result to (1) a tortuosity effect induced by the nanostructure created by the incorporation of an impermeable particle, and to a lesser extent to (2) the modification of the polymer matrix properties by the presence of nanoparticles, or (3) the modification of the availability of specific sorption sites for the sorption of the diffusing molecule. These three assumptions will be discussed in the following paragraphs.</ns0:p>'}], ['4.1.1', 'Tortuosity effect', {1: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">When impermeable nanoparticles are incorporated within a polymer matrix, they act as an obstacle to the diffusion and thus the permeation of diffusing molecules, which have to follow a more tortuous pathway.

Concretely, it could be related to two quantitative parameters, i.e. the in-situ size aspect ratio of the particle and the orientation of nanoparticles.</ns0:p>', 4: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">4.1.1.1. In-situ particle aspect ratio. The size aspect ratio of a nanoparticle is defined as the ratio of its longest dimension to its lowest dimension. Considering the different possible shapes of nanoparticles, it is obvious that the size aspect ratio of a sphere, equal to 1, is lower than that of elongated nanoparticles and nanoplatelets for which very high size aspect ratio could be achieved. The achievement of high size aspect ratios theoretically favors the establishment of a more tortuous pathway. This effect is all the greater for nanoplatelets that allow the creation of 2D obstacles. This has been experimentally validated by Gatos et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b29\">[30]</ns0:ref> who prepared by melt processing fully-exfoliated nanocomposites from a hydrogenated acrylonitrile butadiene rubber polymer and two layered silicates displaying different sizes, i.e. octadecylamine modified montmorillonites with a size aspect ratio of 100 and synthetic fluorohectorite with a size aspect ratio of 200. They observed that the highest decrease of oxygen permeability was achieved using the fluorohectorite as filler, which was ascribed to its higher aspect ratio <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b29\">[30]</ns0:ref>. It must be noted that the achievement of such high in-situ size aspect ratios is exceptional. Indeed, the formation of stacks or tactoïds within the polymer matrix is usually obtained due to the agglomeration and/or incomplete exfoliation of nanoplatelets, resulting in a decrease of the theoretical size aspect ratio. An intercalated nanocomposite structure is thus less tortuous than a full-exfoliated structure. This implies that the in-situ size aspect ratio is usually different from the one of the native nanoparticle. As an example, Angellier-Coussy et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b30\">[31]</ns0:ref> found average values of in-situ size aspect ratio of 17 and 23 for 10.8 and 2.2 vol% of filler, respectively in wheat gluten/montmorillonite based nanocomposites while the size aspect ratio of one native nanoparticle was about 80. This issue is the same for elongated nanoparticles where agglomeration often occurs.</ns0:p>', 5: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">In practice, the knowledge of the in-situ size aspect ratio is thus necessary to fully understand and predict the impact of tortuosity on mass transfer properties. It is usually evaluated using image analysis of TEM pictures when nanoparticles can be easily distinguished from the matrix as is the case for montmorillonite <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b30\">[31]</ns0:ref>. This analysis is tricky and time consuming. Indeed, a large number of images must be analyzed to obtain a significant representativeness of the whole material. In addition, it is well-known that TEM analysis has some inherent limitations due to the fact that it projects three-dimensional (3D) objects onto a two-dimensional (2D) plane, resulting in TEM cross-sections that do not necessarily represent the actual size of all the platelets <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b31\">[32]</ns0:ref>. Furthermore, an ideal image would exhibit sharp transitions from black to white, what is not the case in reality, necessitating the conversion of the original grey-scale TEM micrograph into a black and white image using a semi-automated approach, this step being inevitably accompanied by errors. And finally, this evaluation must be done for each filler content, since the dispersion state strongly depends on the filler content. All these limitations probably explain why the evaluation of the in-situ size aspect ratio is rarely experimentally determined. It is usually an imprecise, unrealistic (if the size aspect ratio of the native nanoparticle is considered) or missing data.</ns0:p>', 6: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">4.1.1.2. In-situ size aspect ratio and dispersion state. As explained above, the in-situ aspect ratio strongly depends on the particle dispersion state. Contrary to the in-situ size aspect ratio, which is rarely determined, the impact of the particle dispersion state on nanocomposite mass transfer properties has been largely demonstrated. For example, Koh et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b32\">[33]</ns0:ref> demonstrated with PLA/organo-modified montmorillonites nanocomposites that the highest decrease of the oxygen and carbon dioxide permeability was obtained for the most exfoliated structure. The same positive impact of exfoliation on permeability decrease was also obtained by Sanchez-Garcia et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b33\">[34]</ns0:ref> in PHBV-PCL nanocomposites and by Sun et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b34\">[35]</ns0:ref> for α-zirconium phosphate/ epoxy resin nanocomposites.</ns0:p>', 7: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">It is worth noting that the achievement of a good dispersion state is all the more difficult as the filler content increases due to agglomeration phenomena, as evidenced in many systems such as agar-(Rhim et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b35\">[36]</ns0:ref>), polyester-(Bharadwaj et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b36\">[37]</ns0:ref>), polyamide-(Picard et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b37\">[38]</ns0:ref>) or polyimide-(Chang et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b38\">[39]</ns0:ref>) based nanocomposites with montmorillonite as nanoparticles. Chemical modification of nanoparticles does not always prevent agglomeration, as evidenced by Zhu et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b39\">[40]</ns0:ref> with modified SiO <sub>2</sub> particles in poly (vinyl chloride) matrix.</ns0:p>', 8: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">4.1.1.3. Orientation. To obtain an optimal decreasing effect on permeability, the largest surface of each nanoparticle must be oriented perpendicular to the direction of the gas diffusion or permeation. Well-oriented and aligned particles perpendicularly to the permeation flux have more impact on the decrease of the permeability than disoriented particles as regards the tortuosity effect. This effect of orientation is only valid for elongated particles and nanoplatelets and, of course, all the more significant for particles with high size aspect ratios. This effect of orientation is also theoretically much more efficient for nanoparticles displaying high size aspect ratio in two dimensions (such as platelets) than only in one dimension (such as elongated particles). In practice, it is an extremely challenging task to achieve a regular arrangement of nanoparticles within the polymer matrix. It is strongly dependent on processing methods. Solution intercalation and in-situ-polymerization are more prone to produce nanostructures with well-aligned and oriented particles than melt intercalation as observed by several authors. It is all the more difficult that particles display high aspect ratio in 2dimension such as platelets. For example, Messersmith et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b40\">[41]</ns0:ref> showed that montmorillonites adopted a planar orientation in the poly (ε-caprolactone) polymer matrix after in-situ-polymerization and solution casting processing while Sanchez-Garcia et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b41\">[42]</ns0:ref> noted that it was difficult to obtain, using melt processing and compression moulding, well aligned and oriented montmorillonites in PHBV-PCL polymer and that a random orientation is at best the most often achieved.</ns0:p>'}], ['4.1.2', 'Modification of the polymer matrix', {1: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">The incorporation of nanoparticles can modify the structure and thus the mass transfer properties of the polymer matrix itself. The two main structural modifications reported to contribute to the decrease of P/P <sub>0</sub> are (i) a reduction of polymer free volume associated to an increase in the glass transition temperature and/or (ii) an increase in crystallinity due to a nucleating effect of nanoparticles. The effect of polymer free volume was for example evidenced in the study of Sadeghi et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b42\">[43]</ns0:ref> by a reduction of the polymer chain mobility in the amorphous phase in the case of polyurethane-silica nanocomposites.

A side effect of this higher affinity is a decrease of the availability of the sorption sites in the polymer. It is particularly true for highly interactive molecules such as water vapor that interacts though hydrogen bonding with hydrophilic sites. These sites bonded with the nanoparticles are not any more available for water sorption. Such changes in specific interactions between the migrant and the polymer were proposed to explain the decrease of water vapor permeability observed by Tunc et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b46\">[47]</ns0:ref> in wheat gluten/montmorillonite or by Lee et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b47\">[48]</ns0:ref> in soy protein/ montmorillonite nanocomposites.</ns0:p>'}], ['4.2', 'Monotonic increase of the permeability', {1: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">Several assumptions are proposed in literature to explain either the absence of significant modification or even an increase of the permeability in nanocomposites: (1) an insufficient tortuosity effect, (2) the occurrence of macroscopic structural defects in the nanocomposite material induced for instance by particles agglomeration, (3) a significant modification of the structure of the polymer matrix such as a decrease of crystallinity or molecular weight, and (4) an increase of migrant sorption induced by nanoparticles (case of water vapor for example, for water sensitive materials). It is worth noting that some mechanisms assumed to explain an increase of P/P <sub>0</sub> were previously discussed for explaining a decrease of P/P <sub>0</sub> (Section 3.1).</ns0:p>'}], ['4.2.1', 'Lack of tortuosity effect', {1: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">In some cases, the dispersion state of nanoparticles did not allow to achieve a sufficient tortuosity effect to slow down the diffusion of migrating molecules, especially for small molecules such as gases. Such an explanation is widely proposed to explain why values of permeability did not change or only slightly decreased in the nanocomposite as compared to the neat matrix. This has been, for example, proposed by Tunc et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b46\">[47]</ns0:ref> to explain the constancy of O <sub>2</sub> permeability in wheat gluten/montmorillonite nanocomposites. In the same article, authors however demonstrated that the achieved tortuosity was nevertheless sufficient for decreasing permeability of bigger molecules such as aroma compounds. This highlighted that the nature, molecular weight and/or steric hindrance of the migrant are also key parameters governing the mass transfer properties in nanocomposites. 4.2.2. Macroscopic structural defects 4.2.2.1. Particle agglomeration. The presence of both nano-or microsized agglomerates and aggregates of particles could induce macroscopic structural defects, which play a major role in the increase of P/P <sub>0</sub> , as already shown for either spherical-based composites with SiO <sub>2</sub> (Cornelius et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b48\">[49]</ns0:ref>), TiO <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (Zoppi et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b49\">[50]</ns0:ref>) or cylinder-based composites with cellulose fibrils (Bilbao-Sainz et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b50\">[51]</ns0:ref>). These agglomeration phenomena are related to a bad dispersion of the nanoparticles which is mainly ascribed to (1) mismatching of the particle polarity, as compared to that of the polymer, resulting in a low affinity between constituents and thus a poor particle/polymer adhesion <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b49\">[50]</ns0:ref> and/or (2) inefficiency of the elaboration technique to separate aggregates.</ns0:p>', 2: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">For example, insufficient shearing forces during the melt processing could cause agglomeration of particles. During casting, sol-gel method and in-situ polymerization, coalescence of the particles during drying of the solution could appear through insufficient particle/particle interactions (\"bad compatibility\"). This last phenomenon is normally limited by chemical modification of the surface of the particles. But when the effect of this chemical modification is wrongly anticipated it could even amplify/trigger coalescence of particles as evidenced by Zhu et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b39\">[40]</ns0:ref> in their study of H <sub>2</sub> 0 and O <sub>2</sub> permeability of silica/PVC nanocomposites with SiO <sub>2</sub> surface grafted with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). They noticed that high content of filling (&gt; 2.5 vol/vol%) increased the permeability of both O <sub>2</sub> and H <sub>2</sub> 0 due to an agglomeration phenomenon owing to the tendency of nanoscale silica modified nanoparticles to be fused together at this concentration. This phenomenon was not anticipated.</ns0:p>', 3: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">Agglomeration could lead to the formation of \"interfacial voids\" at the particle/polymer matrix interface and to the formation of a preferential pathway for the migration of the molecular penetrant (Ismail et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b51\">[52]</ns0:ref>, Rafiq et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b52\">[53]</ns0:ref>). This is further detailed below in the section dedicated to the \"interphase\". 4.2.2.2. Interphase. An interphase, i.e. a \"third compartment\" with its own properties, is generated at the particles/polymer interface due to the establishment of either weak or strong interfacial interactions between the particles and the polymer matrix. Depending on its nature and thickness (or volume fraction), the interphase could significantly participate to the overall mass transfer properties and strongly influence the overall permeability of the composite as evidenced by Liang et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b53\">[54]</ns0:ref> in their poly(ethersulfone)/ montmorillonite nanocomposites. These authors hypothesized that the interphase in their nanocomposite structure was made of interface voids due to a poor adhesion between hydrophilic nanoparticles and hydrophobic polymers contributing to the high gas permeability observed.</ns0:p>'}], ['4.2.3', 'Modification of the polymer matrix', {1: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">The incorporation of nanoparticles could result in the disruption of polymer chain packing, causing an increase of polymer matrix free volume. This increase in free volume leads to an increase in permeability or to a lesser decrease than expected. This impact on free volume is often just a hypothesis that is not always confirmed experimentally, due to the difficulty to experimentally access such information.</ns0:p>', 2: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">Such hypothesis of polymer matrix modification with increase of free volume was speculated by several authors for isodimensional particles-based composites with titanium dioxide (Matteucci et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b54\">[55]</ns0:ref>, Moghadam et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b55\">[56]</ns0:ref>) or silica nanoparticles (Dougnac et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b56\">[57]</ns0:ref>, Romero et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b57\">[58]</ns0:ref>) and in elongated particles-based nanocomposites with carbon nanotube (Murali et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b58\">[59]</ns0:ref>). An increase of free volume was also hypothesized to occur when using compatibilizing agents due to bad compatibility between the compatibilizer and the surface treated particles (Mittal et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b59\">[60]</ns0:ref>). The addition of nanoparticles in a polymer matrix could also hinder the crystallization process if chain mobility is hindered, leading thus to a decrease of the overall crystallinity of the polymer that could contribute to enhance the overall mass transfer within the composite (Dougnac et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b56\">[57]</ns0:ref>).</ns0:p>', 3: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">We noted that this increase of free volume is often considered as a global explanation resulting from different phenomena: in addition to the modification of polymer matrix, increase in free volume could also result in void space formation by nanoparticles aggregation and weak interaction between polymer-nanoparticles at interface (Moghadam et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b55\">[56]</ns0:ref>). All these mechanisms are not easily distinguished. Therefore, authors stressed an overall increase of free volume that they experimentally assessed by density measurements, without distinguishing all underlying mechanisms. Indeed, if the density of the nanoparticles, crystalline polymer and amorphous polymer phases has their pure component values in the nanocomposites, then the density of a nanocomposite sample, would be equal to the theoretical additive density. The difference between theoretical and experimental densities can be rationalized by the overall increase of free volume as evidenced by (Matteucci et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b54\">[55]</ns0:ref>) in spherical-based composites with titanium dioxide.</ns0:p>'}], ['4.2.4', 'Increasing migrant sorption', {1: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">The increase of P/P <sub>0</sub> could be related to the establishment of specific interactions between the molecular penetrant and the material constituents, as largely observed for water vapor and hygroscopic nanoparticles such as silica nanoparticles (Bracho et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b60\">[61]</ns0:ref>, Dougnac et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b56\">[57]</ns0:ref>) or microcrystalline cellulose (Dogan et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b61\">[62]</ns0:ref>), and also for O <sub>2</sub> and organo-modified montmorillonite (Chang et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b62\">[63]</ns0:ref>), for O <sub>2</sub> or modified silica nanoparticles (Iwata et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b63\">[64]</ns0:ref>) or CO <sub>2</sub> and titanium dioxide nanoparticles (Matteucci et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b54\">[55]</ns0:ref>).</ns0:p>', 2: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">Different mechanisms could occur concomitantly, explaining why significant effects on P/P <sub>0</sub> are not systematically observed.

The same happened in the study of Matteucci et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b54\">[55]</ns0:ref>: they observed an enhancement of CO <sub>2</sub> permeability in spherical-based composites with titanium dioxide due to an increase in gas solubility in the nanocomposite films upon incorporation of highly sorbing nanoparticles into the polymer.

For example, in the work of Sanchez-Garcia et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b41\">[42]</ns0:ref> dealing with montmorillonite-based nanocomposites, the permeability first decreased due to a tortuosity effect and then increased for filler contents higher than 5 vol% due to the formation of agglomerates.

In addition to agglomeration that could reverse the trend of variation of P/P <sub>0</sub> , some extensive cracking of the composite film could occur and lead to a complete loss of barrier properties (Chaiko et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b66\">[67]</ns0:ref>), which was attributed by the authors to excessive particle agglomeration at high particle fraction.</ns0:p>', 3: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">An opposite evolution has been also noted in the case of water vapor as migrant: first, an increase of the water vapor permeability probably caused by enhanced affinity between water vapor and composite constituents displaying a hydrophilic nature and, second, a decrease of the permeability induced by the tortuosity that finally is sufficient enough at high loading rates to decrease the permeability value.

Only Semsarzadeh et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b81\">[82]</ns0:ref> calculated the CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity in their study on polyurethane-silica/polyvinyl alcohol mixed matrix membranes. They noticed that by increasing the silica content in membranes, all gas permselectivities including CO <sub>2</sub> , namely CO <sub>2</sub> /N <sub>2</sub> , CO <sub>2</sub> /CH <sub>4</sub> and CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> increased much more than selectivity including other gases such as O <sub>2</sub> / N <sub>2</sub> , up to 136%, 69% and 47%, respectively. They explained that, while O <sub>2</sub> , N <sub>2</sub> and CH <sub>4</sub> displayed decreasing permeability, CO <sub>2</sub> permeability demonstrated an increase upon increasing silica content due to an increase in the number of the active sites (polar OH groups) for gas dissolution in polymer matrix. The same reduced decrease in CO <sub>2</sub> permeability compared to other gases such as O <sub>2</sub> or N <sub>2</sub> was observed by Sadeghi et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b42\">[43,</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b80\">81]</ns0:ref> in polyether-based polyurethane-silica and polyurethane-silica nanocomposite leading to moderate increase of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> selectivity as a function of nanoparticle content (Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">7a</ns0:ref>).</ns0:p>', 5: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">The comparative examination of permeability and selectivity variation of data collected in the database considered in this work is now in order. Indeed, for the case of inclusion of impermeable particles in a permeable polymer matrix, the anticipated mechanism of induced tortuosity in path of gas molecules is expected to reduce the permeability of different gases by the same extent. A further analysis was thus performed to explore possible correlation between relative permeability and permselectivity in the available set of data. The examination is confined to the case of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> selectivity in nanocomposite obtained from the inclusion of isodimensional or platelet shaped nanoparticles, as only for those cases is a sufficient number of data available to insure the significance of the statistical analysis. In Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_9\">9</ns0:ref> the relative permeability for CO <sub>2</sub> in the nanocomposites is related to the corresponding square variation of permselectivity δ defined as follows:</ns0:p>', 6: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">where α <sub>NC</sub> and α <sub>M</sub> are CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity in nanocomposite and neat matrix, respectively. Despite the scattering, data in Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_9\">9</ns0:ref> put in evidence that, both for the case of isodimensional particles and platelets, relative permeability higher than one is typically accompanied by a significant deviation of nanocomposite permselectivity from the value of neat matrix, while an interval exists for relative permeability of nanocomposite moderately lower than 1, for which the deviation in permselectivity from the value of neat matrix is negligible. Significantly, the above interval for relative permeability extends to lower values for the case of nanocomposites including platelets with respect to the case of isodimensional particles. It can be thus concluded that a good number of studies considered in this work shows results which are at least qualitatively consistent with the picture resulting from the tortuosity effect induced by the dispersed phase to the motion of gas molecules. On the other hand, a large number of nanocomposites exhibiting either relative permeability values higher than one or very low seems to be often characterized by significant variation of the permselectivity, indicating the relevance of additional phenomena hiding the effect of a pure increase in tortuosity path for the motion of gas molecules in the system. As it can be seen in Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">8</ns0:ref>, data available to calculate H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity are much scarcer than for CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> and, for this reason, the correlation between relative permeability and deviation of permselectivity is not discussed here for this kind of data. No values were even found in the collected references for calculated H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity in iso-dimensional nanoparticle based nanocomposites. Only three references were found for elongated ones. O <sub>2</sub> permeability is rarely investigated concomitantly to H <sub>2</sub> O permeability although H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity is a very important value in many applications such as packaging where sometimes a high barrier property to O <sub>2</sub> is required at the same time as low barrier to H <sub>2</sub> 0. From Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\">8</ns0:ref>, it can be concluded that the H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity did not vary so much as a function of nanoparticle volume fraction except for the study of Kasirga et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b73\">[74]</ns0:ref>, Chang et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b38\">[39]</ns0:ref> and Lee et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b47\">[48]</ns0:ref> where H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity tended to dramatically increase then decrease for at least Chang et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b38\">[39]</ns0:ref> and Lee et al. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b47\">[48]</ns0:ref>. Even if none of these authors intentionally measured nor explained the evolution of H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity, this behavior could be generally ascribed to a better tortuosity effect obtained for H <sub>2</sub> O than for O <sub>2</sub> and, for non-monotonic behavior, to nonlinear decrease in permeability with clay loading.</ns0:p>', 7: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">To conclude about the selective transport characteristics of nanocomposites membranes, the previous analysis has highlighted that a correlation exists between permeability and the corresponding selectivity value which could be used to emphasize that deviations from expected behavior for selectivity (either positive or negative variation of selectivity) are often associated with deviations from expected behavior for permeability (very high reduction or increase).</ns0:p>'}], ['5', 'Conclusion', {1: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">The recently-measured values of gas (O <sub>2</sub> , CO <sub>2</sub> ) and water vapor permeability in agro-, bio-and synthetic-based nanocomposites have been comprehensively reviewed with emphases on the link between their micro-and nano-structure and their barrier performance.</ns0:p>', 2: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">This review has revealed that despite numerous and intensive studies on the optimization of nanocomposite processing and structure in the perspective of modulating their barrier properties, the expected decreasing effect on the permeability is often not so high as expected and sometimes completely the opposite. This review confirmed that layered nanoparticles are more efficient than isodimensional and elongated nanoparticles to decrease the relative permeability (P/P <sub>0</sub> ). But, this effect is difficult to anticipate due to numerous interfering mechanisms that provoke modifications of tortuosity, sorption, polymer matrix (crystallinity, free volume, molar mass), creation of an interphase, voids and cracks, and more that lead to unexpected behaviors of the permeability in nanocomposites. Investigation of the selective transport of CO <sub>2</sub> to O <sub>2</sub> and H <sub>2</sub> 0 to O <sub>2</sub> did not reveal a general trend either and it is also difficult to anticipate.</ns0:p>', 3: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">It was concluded that tortuosity, the main mechanism proposed to explain permeability decrease in nanocomposites, often fails in explaining the effect of nanoparticles on nanocomposite barrier properties.

      "[['0', 'Abstract', {1: \"More than 1000 published experimental data of gas (O 2 and CO 2 ) and vapor (H 2 O) permeability in nanocomposites containing either spherical, elongated or platelet particles were collected, assorted and compared in order to decipher the role of particle shape on the reduction of the relative permeability of the nanocomposite. It is well known that inclusion of homogeneously dispersed and oriented impermeable fillers with high aspect ratio, such as platelets or elongated particles, should significantly increase the diffusion path of gas and vapors and yield to improve barrier properties. Results revealed that this expected impact was not systematically achieved, even for impermeable lamellar fillers that usually displayed the highest aspect ratio. More specifically, an unexpected increase of the permeability in the nanocomposite was often observed. To explain this deviation of the 'ideal behavior', this paper discusses extensively the impact of the nanoparticle shape on the nanocomposite permeability along with structural aspects, related to both the particle nature and size, and the nanocomposite processing routes. Deviations from expected results of enhanced barrier effect are also discussed in correlation with unexpected variations in gas selectivity for O 2 /CO 2 pair. Lastly, this review aims at drawing meaningful conclusions on the structure/mass transfer relationships and giving directions for the development of the next generation of packaging materials with tailored mass transfer properties.\"}], ['1', 'Introduction', {1: 'In the objective of developing efficient and optimal packaging, one of the main challenges is to design and provide food packaging materials able to protect the food from the external environment and to maintain food quality and safety throughout its shelf life . The mass transfers are thus at the heart of the feature of the food packaging, especially transfers of water vapor, oxygen and/or carbon dioxide, which condition the rates of numerous reactions of food degradation (oxidation, microbial development, physiological reactions, etc.). The development of bulk nanocomposite structures by introducing nanoparticles, i.e. fillers having at least one dimension lower than 100 nm, in polymeric matrices appeared as one of the most promising directions in the development of packaging materials with advanced mass transfer properties. The expected role of these inclusions is to achieve a significant decrease of the mass transfer properties as compared to the neat matrix by acting as physical obstacles to the diffusion and permeation of diffusing molecules, which have to follow a more tortuous pathway. This phenomenon is called the tortuosity effect.', 2: 'Many types of nanoparticles have already been tested to modulate mass transfer properties, with hundreds of permeability data published in literature. Nanoparticles can be classified into three major categories according to their particle shape (Fig. ): (i) isodimensional particles, that have the same size in all directions and an aspect ratio close to unity (such as spherical silica, TiO <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles, carbon black and fullerenes); (ii) elongated particles that consist in fibrils with a diameter ranging between 1 and 100 nm and length up to several hundred nanometers (such as carbon nanotubes or cellulose nanofibers); and (iii) layered particles that are characterized by one dimension ranging from several angstroms to several nanometers (such as layered silicates or starch nanocrystals). Among the three aforementioned types of particles, it is widely recognized that inclusion of impermeable platelets such as clays in the polymer should significantly enhance its barrier properties. However, an in-depth study of the available data in the literature revealed that it was not systematically the case and, even, on the contrary could lead to a deterioration of the barrier properties. Many reviews deal with the functional properties of nanocomposites, by mainly focusing on mechanical properties . Among these studies, some of them focused slightly on the mass transfer properties  but without deepening the topic. These studies generally focused on one type of nanoparticle, i.e. spherical nanoparticles or nano-platelets for instance, particularly for membrane applications. Few of them focused on food packaging applications . The last exhaustive review in the field is that of Cui et al.  that focused on gas barrier properties of clay-based polymer nanocomposites. However, the effect of the platelet-shape has never been compared and discussed along with results obtained with spherical and elongated particle shape. In spite of all these preceding reviews, there is still a huge lack of analysis of all available data in the perspective of deciphering the role of particle shape on the mass transfer properties of the resulting nanocomposite materials, even if it has been highlighted as a key input parameter in mathematical models. As far as we knew, there is no review that proposes an exhaustive analysis of the experimental permeability values from the available literature.', 3: 'In order to better correlate the mass transfer properties in nanocomposite materials with their multi-scale structure, the objective of the present review is to decipher and comprehensively discuss the role of the nanoparticle shape (either isodimensional, elongated or layered) on the modulation of the mass transfer properties in nanocomposites, as a function of filler volume fraction and in the light of the nanocomposite structure achieved. For that purpose, more than 1000 values (i.e. about 170 articles) of the 1995-2015 period containing measured values of O <sub>2</sub> , CO <sub>2</sub> and H <sub>2</sub> O permeability in polymer-based nanocomposites were collected from the available literature and capitalized in a dedicated on-line database . All data could be uploaded from the permalink provided in figure caption (https://doi.org/10.5281/ zenodo.1136269). The proposed on-line database consists in the first and unprecedented compilation of permeability values for nanocomposite based materials. The current work is focused on direct analysis and comparison of experiments, without any mediation which could be provided by quantitative models. It must be specified that, in order to build up the database for analysis, which is of interest here, recent data for gas barrier in polymer based materials with dispersed graphene and graphene derivatives were not taken into consideration. In fact, while the latter represent nanocomposite materials with dispersed layered domains, the extremely high aspect ratio and flexibility of graphene layers reduces the threshold value for percolation in these materials to much lower values than in traditional layered particles nanocomposites . Under those conditions, in the volume concentration range for layered particles which is of reference in this work (in the order of 10% by volume) layers arrangement and layer defects are significantly more relevant to the barrier effect than the aspect ratio (particle shape) itself. For a comparison between gas barrier properties in polymer/clay and polymer/graphene nanocomposite see the review by Tan . For the above reason, although graphene has attracted much attention in recent years for the production of polymer based composites for packaging, analysis of pertinent results for gas barrier properties is left to a different discussion and the interested reader is addressed to recent reviews in the field .', 4: 'Besides the meaningful conclusions on the role of nanoparticle shape, the main output of this paper is to give some recommendations for the design of nanocomposite packaging materials with tunable mass transfer properties.'}], ['2', 'Brief overview of nanocomposites processing and morphologies', {1: 'All the processes used to prepare polymer-based nanocomposites have already been extensively detailed in dedicated reviews and are not further detailed here. Examples of reference publications for layered silicates-based nanocomposites are those of Alexandre &amp; Dubois , Ray et al. , Pavlidou et al. , Mittal et al.  and Cui et al. , for natural fibre-based nanocomposites, those of Saheb et al.  and Siqueira et al.  and for inorganic spherical particle-based nanocomposites, those of Cong et al.  and Chung et al. . Due to the large range of polymer matrices and nanoparticles, different processing routes have been proposed to produce nanocomposites based on their convenience according to the nature of the raw constituents and their field of application (Fig. ). At laboratory scale, four main processes are most commonly used to prepare polymer-based nanocomposites from all the types of nanoparticles. Melt processing and solution blending are two processes based on the use of polymers, which lead to the formation of Van der Waals interactions between the constituents, while insitu polymerization and sol/gel methods are based on the use of monomers or oligomers, leading to the formation of covalent bonds between the polymer and the nanoparticles (Fig. ). At industrial scale, melt processing is generally preferred due to the difficulty to implement processes requiring the use of huge volumes of solvent.', 2: 'Depending on the processing conditions, the particle shape and the affinity between constituents, i.e. the polymer matrix and the nanoparticle, different morphologies can be obtained. For isodimensional and elongated nanoparticles, three arrangements can be observed, i.e. (i) well-dispersed, (ii) agglomerated, or (iii) percolating systems. For platelets, specific names are given to the various possible morphologies: (i) micro-composite, (ii) intercalated nanocomposite or (iii) fully exfoliated nanocomposites. The micro-composite structure corresponds to '}], ['3', 'Effect of the nanoparticle shape on the modulation of mass transfer properties', {}], ['3.1', 'Theoretical background', {1: 'A great amount of effort has been made in the literature to describe the effect on transport properties of the inclusion of non-conducting particles into a conductive matrix and the effect of particle shape has been a focus since the beginning of these studies. Similar analyses of the problem can be found in the field of electrical properties (electrical conductivity/permittivity) as well as in that of heat or mass transfer (thermal conductivity/mass diffusivity). Exact solutions in terms of effective conductivity of the composite medium have been obtained already by Maxwell in 1873  for the case of dilute mixture of spherical domains (\"non-interacting particles\") perfectly adhering to the matrix. These exact solutions assume that the properties of dispersed and continuous phase in the composite are the same than the one measured in the corresponding pure materials (\"ideal interface condition\").', 2: 'Wiener  in 1912 extended the results to the case of dilute dispersion of long cylinders in the matrix, all aligned in the direction normal to the overall flux. While exact solutions are also available for the case of spheroids (dilute mixture, perfect alignment), empirical relations as well as numerical result have been discussed for the case of different shapes of the inclusions. Among the best, known results of this kind are those obtained by Nielsen  in 1967 following empirical ideas about the increase in contour length of path of diffusing molecules in the composite medium due to the presence of impermeable inclusions in the form of bricks. The specific expression for effective conductivity as function of particle concentration in the composite as derived from the above models is not here presented and discussed, as the direct comparison of available experimental results with model predictions is not relevant to this work. On the other hand, it is useful to remember here that all the above approaches consistently predict a decrease in the conductivity when the concentration of impermeable particles in the composite increases. In general terms, it can be said that, assuming ideal interface and non-interacting particle condition, the effective conductivity of the composite medium is expected to be half the value of the pure matrix when the concentration of dispersed phase approaches 40% vol for isometric particles, 30% vol for elongated particles aligned normally to the flux, and a much lower value, only few percent, depending on the exact shape, for layered particles lying in planes orthogonal to the flux.', 3: 'It should be finally mentioned that more complex analyses are definitely needed to consider the interaction between particles in the medium (concentrated mixtures), the distribution in their orientation, as well the non-ideal interaction with the matrix which can ultimately result in regions close to the interface with properties different from that of pure materials .

All these papers, dealing with nanocomposite materials, presented at least one value of permeability in relation to their composition. The nanoparticles considered in works examined in this review are those assumed as impermeable and non-porous with respect to the application that is focused on: barrier membranes mainly for packaging application. Moreover, it must be noted that mass transfer does not follow the same mechanisms in dense and porous material and that mixing porous and non-porous materials may disturb the analysis. Only gases (O <sub>2</sub> and CO <sub>2</sub> ) and water vapor permeability data were considered because of their high interest for food packaging applications. These data were analyzed as regard to the particle shape (isodimensional, elongated, or platelet), the filler volume fraction, the eventual chemical and functionalization treatments applied to the nanoparticle and the elaboration technique used to prepare materials. The main characteristics of the nanocomposites studied in the present review are gathered in Tables 1-3.', 2: 'In the following, the evolution of the relative permeability, i.e. the ratio of the composite permeability to the permeability of the neat matrix (P/P <sub>0</sub> ), was represented as a function of the nanoparticle volume fraction (φ <sub>vol</sub> ), which is considered as input parameter in all mathematical models. This implied to systematically calculate φ <sub>vol</sub> values from weight fractions (φ <sub>wt</sub> ) values given in the original papers, based on the knowledge of the true density of each constituent (Eq. ( )):', 3: 'where ρ <sub>matrix</sub> and ρ <sub>nanoparticle</sub> are the true density of the matrix and the nanoparticles respectively. Such a conversion led to unavoidable uncertainty on φ vol .'}], ['3.3', 'Modulation of mass transfer properties in nanocomposites: global evolution of P/P ', {1: 'Most of the studies of O <sub>2</sub> , CO <sub>2</sub> and H <sub>2</sub> O permeability in nanocomposites were carried out in platelets-based nanocomposites with about 100 publications on the topic resulting in a total of 710 permeability values. All of them have been represented in Fig.  leading to a scatter graph in which each individual study could not, of course, be distinguished. For comparison, 45 publications were found for isodimensional nanoparticles-based nanocomposites against 22 for elongated nanoparticles-based nanocomposites, resulting in about 380 and 120 permeability values respectively (Fig. ). Papers dealing with elongated particle displaying micrometric sizes (13 papers more) were voluntary excluded from this review. Due to the high number of studies found for each type of particle shape (for O <sub>2</sub> , CO <sub>2</sub> and H <sub>2</sub> O permeability), the figures are overloaded and thus not easily readable. Three complementary figures have been drawn for each type of particle shape and for each molecule studied, i.e. O <sub>2</sub> , H <sub>2</sub> O and CO <sub>2</sub> respectively. Analysis of these general figures permits to highlight the intensive work on the topic and to draw the general tendencies of P/P <sub>0</sub> variation as a function of nanoparticle shape and φ <sub>vol</sub> and nature of the penetrant.

Only 3 publications (i.e. 11 permeability values) were in the range of 15-40 vol% for nanoplatelets-based nanocomposites (not shown in Fig. ). This feature could be ascribed to the fact that usually, only a small weight fraction of nanoplatelets (generally 1-5 wt%) is necessary to obtain a significant effect on the material functional properties.', 3: '• <super>The</super> <super>evolution</super> <super>and</super> <super>variation</super> <super>amplitude</super> <super>of</super> <super>P/P</super> <super>0</super> <super>as</super> <super>a</super> <super>function</super> <super>of</super> <super>the</super> nanoparticle volume fraction is really complex and does not follow the same trend according to the shape of nanoparticles (Fig. ). Fig.  and b permit to point out that the addition of isodimensional or elongated nanoparticles in a polymer generally provokes either a monotonic decrease or increase of P/P <sub>0</sub> with an amplitude of variation ranging from 0.15 to 16 and from 0.1 to 18, respectively. This leads to a scatter graph of P/P <sub>0</sub> with a general aspect in herringbones centered on P/P <sub>0</sub> = 1.

This could be easily ascribed to the particle geometry and the more pronounced tortuosity effect induced by platelets as compared to spheres or cylinders. To go further, an in-depth, quantitative analysis of the data collected and capitalized was carried out.'}], ['3.4', 'In-depth analysis of the modulation of mass transfer properties per type of nanoparticle', {1: 'In order to perform a quantitative analysis of the efficiency of each type of nanoparticle shape on P/P <sub>0</sub> , all the permeability data collected in the literature were gathered on a histogram displaying the percentage of values per class of modulation, i.e. per range of P/P <sub>0</sub> values. The maximum number of permeability values collected for isodimensional (43%), elongated (29%) and layered (30%) nanoparticles is obtained for the classes 1 &lt; P/P <sub>0</sub> &lt; 2, 1 &lt; P/P <sub>0</sub> &lt; 2, and 0.6 &lt; P/P <sub>0</sub> &lt; 0.8 respectively, confirming that layered nanoparticles were more prone to improve the barrier properties of a given polymer (Fig. ).', 2: 'Besides this main impact, secondary peaks are observed on Fig. . In the case of isodimensional nanoparticles, 17% of values are obtained for the class 2 &lt; P/P <sub>0</sub> &lt; 3 and 14% for 0.8 &lt; P/P <sub>0</sub> &lt; 1, indicating that the permeability in these nanocomposites could be equally multiplied by a factor of 3 or slightly decreased by a factor of 0.8. This feature confirms well the herringbone scatter graph observed when all P/P <sub>0</sub> data are plotted as a function of φ <sub>vol</sub> (Fig. ).', 3: 'In the case of elongated nanoparticles, 17% of collected data belong to the class 0.6 &lt; P/P <sub>0</sub> &lt; 0.8 and another 17% to the class 0.8 &lt; P/ P <sub>0</sub> &lt; 1. This indicated that even if the main observed effect of the addition of elongated nanoparticles is a weak increase of permeability up to a factor 2, it could also statistically lead to a decrease of the permeability.', 4: 'In the case of layered nanoparticles, the overall trend of decreasing permeability is confirmed by the occurrence of secondary peaks, which reveals that 23% of permeability values were obtained for 0.4 &lt; P/P <sub>0</sub> 0.6 and 21% for 0.8 &lt; P/P <sub>0</sub> &lt; 1. In all the cases, P/P <sub>0</sub> values higher than 3 are very rare (less than 6% of the studies for every particle shape).', 5: 'To verify if the conclusions drawn from this global analysis were confirmed for all the tested filler contents, permeability values were also apportioned into classes of filler volume fraction in addition to the classes of P/P <sub>0</sub> values (Fig. ). The classes chosen for filler fractions were 0-5 vol%, 5-10 vol%, 10-20 vol% and 20-30 vol%. For this analysis, the range for P/P <sub>0</sub> was limited to a maximal value of 3, considering that a higher increase of the permeability ratio was an exceptional behavior. In the case of isodimensional nanoparticles, exactly the same evolution of P/P <sub>0</sub> is obtained for each filler fraction, with an Fig. .

For elongated nanoparticles, the same increase of P/P <sub>0</sub> is obtained but only for filler contents lower than 20 vol%. For higher filler contents, no clear tendency is evidenced, with a disordered shape of the curve. This could be due to agglomerated or percolated structures that become frequent for such high concentration in fillers whose effect on permeability is more unpredictable (Fig. ). Finally, for nanoplatelets-based nanocomposites, for filler contents lower than 5 vol%, the evolution of P/P <sub>0</sub> is the same as the general one previously observed on Fig.  and is characterized by a main peak (30% of data) centered on the class 0.6-0.8. This main peak shifts to lower P/P <sub>0</sub> values, i.e. better efficiency, for filler contents ranging from 5 to 10 vol%, with a main peak (38%) for P/P <sub>0</sub> values in the range of 0.4-0.6. For filler content higher than 10 vol%, the decrease in permeability is not confirmed anymore. We noted that studies conducted with such high amounts of platelets (&gt; 10 vol%) were scarce, which makes it difficult to generalize the effect of high contents of platelets on the permeability of resulting nanocomposites (Fig. ).', 6: 'To sum up, beyond the fact that modulation of the permeability is clearly affected by the shape of the nanoparticles, three conclusions (i) whatever the filler content, the addition of isodimensional particles does not statistically impact the permeability of resulting nanocomposites very much, (ii) a significant decrease of permeability could be achieved by nanostructuring polymer matrices with the introduction of either elongated or nanoplatelets-shaped nanoparticles, with a much higher efficiency of layered nanoparticles. Indeed, the use of filler contents higher than 20 vol% are necessary to achieve a significant decrease of P/P <sub>0</sub> in the case of elongated nanoparticles while less than 10 vol% are sufficient in the case of nanoplatelets, (iii) the barrier effect of nanoplatelets is even more pronounced for filler contents ranging from 5 to 10 vol%.', 7: 'This analysis has also revealed that the behavior of P/P <sub>0</sub> is more complex than expected, with the occurrence of non-monotonic behaviors, especially in the case of elongated nanoparticles. In the following, Fig. . (continued) lines of explanation will be tentatively brought in order to relate this \"shape effect\" to the morphology of the particle and the (nano)-structure of the composite.'}], ['4', 'In-depth investigation and understanding of the mass transfer properties/structure relationships in nanocomposites', {1: 'In the following section, a case by case qualitative explanation of the modulation of the permeability according to particle morphology will be proposed by focusing on the nanostructure obtained and its relationship with mass transfer properties. Three cases will be considered: (1) \"ideal\" case of monotonic decrease of P/P <sub>0</sub> , (2) monotonic increase of P/P <sub>0</sub> and (3) non-monotonic variation of P/P 0 . A critical discussion relying on the mechanisms proposed by the different authors will be offered.'}], ['4.1', 'Monotonic decrease of the permeability', {1: 'Theoretically, the incorporation of impermeable particles displaying a good compatibility with the polymer matrix should favor the decrease of the permeability of gases and water vapor through an increase of the tortuous path for the diffusing molecules. Such \"ideal\" cases were largely observed in data collected from literature, as illustrated on Fig.  for a large range of nanoparticles displaying various shapes, either isodimensional, elongated or nanoplatelets. For the sake of clarity, the exhaustive list of these references is in footnote. <super>1</super> The amplitude of this decrease largely depends on the particle shape and/or particle volume fraction used. The authors mainly attributed this result to (1) a tortuosity effect induced by the nanostructure created by the incorporation of an impermeable particle, and to a lesser extent to (2) the modification of the polymer matrix properties by the presence of nanoparticles, or (3) the modification of the availability of specific sorption sites for the sorption of the diffusing molecule. These three assumptions will be discussed in the following paragraphs.'}], ['4.1.1', 'Tortuosity effect', {1: 'When impermeable nanoparticles are incorporated within a polymer matrix, they act as an obstacle to the diffusion and thus the permeation of diffusing molecules, which have to follow a more tortuous pathway. Mathematically, tortuosity (τ) represents the ratio of the distance that a molecular specie must follow through the nanocomposite thickness to the distance through the neat polymer.', 2: 'This tortuosity effect is influenced by the volume fraction and the  <super>1</super> Among studies that observed a decrease of P/P <sub>0</sub> , we can cite the following papers:', 3: 'For spherical particles: dispersion and distribution states of nanoparticles within the polymer matrix. Concretely, it could be related to two quantitative parameters, i.e. the in-situ size aspect ratio of the particle and the orientation of nanoparticles.', 4: '4.1.1.1. In-situ particle aspect ratio. The size aspect ratio of a nanoparticle is defined as the ratio of its longest dimension to its lowest dimension. Considering the different possible shapes of nanoparticles, it is obvious that the size aspect ratio of a sphere, equal to 1, is lower than that of elongated nanoparticles and nanoplatelets for which very high size aspect ratio could be achieved. The achievement of high size aspect ratios theoretically favors the establishment of a more tortuous pathway. This effect is all the greater for nanoplatelets that allow the creation of 2D obstacles. This has been experimentally validated by Gatos et al.  who prepared by melt processing fully-exfoliated nanocomposites from a hydrogenated acrylonitrile butadiene rubber polymer and two layered silicates displaying different sizes, i.e. octadecylamine modified montmorillonites with a size aspect ratio of 100 and synthetic fluorohectorite with a size aspect ratio of 200. They observed that the highest decrease of oxygen permeability was achieved using the fluorohectorite as filler, which was ascribed to its higher aspect ratio . It must be noted that the achievement of such high in-situ size aspect ratios is exceptional. Indeed, the formation of stacks or tactoïds within the polymer matrix is usually obtained due to the agglomeration and/or incomplete exfoliation of nanoplatelets, resulting in a decrease of the theoretical size aspect ratio. An intercalated nanocomposite structure is thus less tortuous than a full-exfoliated structure. This implies that the in-situ size aspect ratio is usually different from the one of the native nanoparticle. As an example, Angellier-Coussy et al.  found average values of in-situ size aspect ratio of 17 and 23 for 10.8 and 2.2 vol% of filler, respectively in wheat gluten/montmorillonite based nanocomposites while the size aspect ratio of one native nanoparticle was about 80. This issue is the same for elongated nanoparticles where agglomeration often occurs.', 5: 'In practice, the knowledge of the in-situ size aspect ratio is thus necessary to fully understand and predict the impact of tortuosity on mass transfer properties. It is usually evaluated using image analysis of TEM pictures when nanoparticles can be easily distinguished from the matrix as is the case for montmorillonite . This analysis is tricky and time consuming. Indeed, a large number of images must be analyzed to obtain a significant representativeness of the whole material. In addition, it is well-known that TEM analysis has some inherent limitations due to the fact that it projects three-dimensional (3D) objects onto a two-dimensional (2D) plane, resulting in TEM cross-sections that do not necessarily represent the actual size of all the platelets . Furthermore, an ideal image would exhibit sharp transitions from black to white, what is not the case in reality, necessitating the conversion of the original grey-scale TEM micrograph into a black and white image using a semi-automated approach, this step being inevitably accompanied by errors. And finally, this evaluation must be done for each filler content, since the dispersion state strongly depends on the filler content. All these limitations probably explain why the evaluation of the in-situ size aspect ratio is rarely experimentally determined. It is usually an imprecise, unrealistic (if the size aspect ratio of the native nanoparticle is considered) or missing data.', 6: '4.1.1.2. In-situ size aspect ratio and dispersion state. As explained above, the in-situ aspect ratio strongly depends on the particle dispersion state. Contrary to the in-situ size aspect ratio, which is rarely determined, the impact of the particle dispersion state on nanocomposite mass transfer properties has been largely demonstrated. For example, Koh et al.  demonstrated with PLA/organo-modified montmorillonites nanocomposites that the highest decrease of the oxygen and carbon dioxide permeability was obtained for the most exfoliated structure. The same positive impact of exfoliation on permeability decrease was also obtained by Sanchez-Garcia et al.  in PHBV-PCL nanocomposites and by Sun et al.  for α-zirconium phosphate/ epoxy resin nanocomposites.', 7: 'It is worth noting that the achievement of a good dispersion state is all the more difficult as the filler content increases due to agglomeration phenomena, as evidenced in many systems such as agar-(Rhim et al. ), polyester-(Bharadwaj et al. ), polyamide-(Picard et al. ) or polyimide-(Chang et al. ) based nanocomposites with montmorillonite as nanoparticles. Chemical modification of nanoparticles does not always prevent agglomeration, as evidenced by Zhu et al.  with modified SiO <sub>2</sub> particles in poly (vinyl chloride) matrix.', 8: '4.1.1.3. Orientation. To obtain an optimal decreasing effect on permeability, the largest surface of each nanoparticle must be oriented perpendicular to the direction of the gas diffusion or permeation. Well-oriented and aligned particles perpendicularly to the permeation flux have more impact on the decrease of the permeability than disoriented particles as regards the tortuosity effect. This effect of orientation is only valid for elongated particles and nanoplatelets and, of course, all the more significant for particles with high size aspect ratios. This effect of orientation is also theoretically much more efficient for nanoparticles displaying high size aspect ratio in two dimensions (such as platelets) than only in one dimension (such as elongated particles). In practice, it is an extremely challenging task to achieve a regular arrangement of nanoparticles within the polymer matrix. It is strongly dependent on processing methods. Solution intercalation and in-situ-polymerization are more prone to produce nanostructures with well-aligned and oriented particles than melt intercalation as observed by several authors. It is all the more difficult that particles display high aspect ratio in 2dimension such as platelets. For example, Messersmith et al.  showed that montmorillonites adopted a planar orientation in the poly (ε-caprolactone) polymer matrix after in-situ-polymerization and solution casting processing while Sanchez-Garcia et al.  noted that it was difficult to obtain, using melt processing and compression moulding, well aligned and oriented montmorillonites in PHBV-PCL polymer and that a random orientation is at best the most often achieved.'}], ['4.1.2', 'Modification of the polymer matrix', {1: 'The incorporation of nanoparticles can modify the structure and thus the mass transfer properties of the polymer matrix itself. The two main structural modifications reported to contribute to the decrease of P/P <sub>0</sub> are (i) a reduction of polymer free volume associated to an increase in the glass transition temperature and/or (ii) an increase in crystallinity due to a nucleating effect of nanoparticles. The effect of polymer free volume was for example evidenced in the study of Sadeghi et al.  by a reduction of the polymer chain mobility in the amorphous phase in the case of polyurethane-silica nanocomposites. The impact of nanoparticles on polymer crystallinity was largely reported for either spherical particles such as silica nanoparticles (Vladimirov et al. ; Vassiliou et al. ) or layered particles such as montmorillonite (Sanchez-Garcia et al. ; Ghasemi et al. ). Crystallites act as obstacles to migrant diffusion.'}], ['4.1.3', 'Decrease of polymer sorption sites', {1: 'The chemical modification of the nanoparticle surface is generally performed to reach a better filler/matrix affinity and thus a better dispersion of nanofillers within the polymer matrix. A side effect of this higher affinity is a decrease of the availability of the sorption sites in the polymer. It is particularly true for highly interactive molecules such as water vapor that interacts though hydrogen bonding with hydrophilic sites. These sites bonded with the nanoparticles are not any more available for water sorption. Such changes in specific interactions between the migrant and the polymer were proposed to explain the decrease of water vapor permeability observed by Tunc et al.  in wheat gluten/montmorillonite or by Lee et al.  in soy protein/ montmorillonite nanocomposites.'}], ['4.2', 'Monotonic increase of the permeability', {1: 'Several assumptions are proposed in literature to explain either the absence of significant modification or even an increase of the permeability in nanocomposites: (1) an insufficient tortuosity effect, (2) the occurrence of macroscopic structural defects in the nanocomposite material induced for instance by particles agglomeration, (3) a significant modification of the structure of the polymer matrix such as a decrease of crystallinity or molecular weight, and (4) an increase of migrant sorption induced by nanoparticles (case of water vapor for example, for water sensitive materials). It is worth noting that some mechanisms assumed to explain an increase of P/P <sub>0</sub> were previously discussed for explaining a decrease of P/P <sub>0</sub> (Section 3.1).'}], ['4.2.1', 'Lack of tortuosity effect', {1: 'In some cases, the dispersion state of nanoparticles did not allow to achieve a sufficient tortuosity effect to slow down the diffusion of migrating molecules, especially for small molecules such as gases. Such an explanation is widely proposed to explain why values of permeability did not change or only slightly decreased in the nanocomposite as compared to the neat matrix. This has been, for example, proposed by Tunc et al.  to explain the constancy of O <sub>2</sub> permeability in wheat gluten/montmorillonite nanocomposites. In the same article, authors however demonstrated that the achieved tortuosity was nevertheless sufficient for decreasing permeability of bigger molecules such as aroma compounds. This highlighted that the nature, molecular weight and/or steric hindrance of the migrant are also key parameters governing the mass transfer properties in nanocomposites. 4.2.2. Macroscopic structural defects 4.2.2.1. Particle agglomeration. The presence of both nano-or microsized agglomerates and aggregates of particles could induce macroscopic structural defects, which play a major role in the increase of P/P <sub>0</sub> , as already shown for either spherical-based composites with SiO <sub>2</sub> (Cornelius et al. ), TiO <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (Zoppi et al. ) or cylinder-based composites with cellulose fibrils (Bilbao-Sainz et al. ). These agglomeration phenomena are related to a bad dispersion of the nanoparticles which is mainly ascribed to (1) mismatching of the particle polarity, as compared to that of the polymer, resulting in a low affinity between constituents and thus a poor particle/polymer adhesion  and/or (2) inefficiency of the elaboration technique to separate aggregates.', 2: 'For example, insufficient shearing forces during the melt processing could cause agglomeration of particles. During casting, sol-gel method and in-situ polymerization, coalescence of the particles during drying of the solution could appear through insufficient particle/particle interactions (\"bad compatibility\"). This last phenomenon is normally limited by chemical modification of the surface of the particles. But when the effect of this chemical modification is wrongly anticipated it could even amplify/trigger coalescence of particles as evidenced by Zhu et al.  in their study of H <sub>2</sub> 0 and O <sub>2</sub> permeability of silica/PVC nanocomposites with SiO <sub>2</sub> surface grafted with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). They noticed that high content of filling (&gt; 2.5 vol/vol%) increased the permeability of both O <sub>2</sub> and H <sub>2</sub> 0 due to an agglomeration phenomenon owing to the tendency of nanoscale silica modified nanoparticles to be fused together at this concentration. This phenomenon was not anticipated.', 3: 'Agglomeration could lead to the formation of \"interfacial voids\" at the particle/polymer matrix interface and to the formation of a preferential pathway for the migration of the molecular penetrant (Ismail et al. , Rafiq et al. ). This is further detailed below in the section dedicated to the \"interphase\". 4.2.2.2. Interphase. An interphase, i.e. a \"third compartment\" with its own properties, is generated at the particles/polymer interface due to the establishment of either weak or strong interfacial interactions between the particles and the polymer matrix. Depending on its nature and thickness (or volume fraction), the interphase could significantly participate to the overall mass transfer properties and strongly influence the overall permeability of the composite as evidenced by Liang et al.  in their poly(ethersulfone)/ montmorillonite nanocomposites. These authors hypothesized that the interphase in their nanocomposite structure was made of interface voids due to a poor adhesion between hydrophilic nanoparticles and hydrophobic polymers contributing to the high gas permeability observed.'}], ['4.2.3', 'Modification of the polymer matrix', {1: 'The incorporation of nanoparticles could result in the disruption of polymer chain packing, causing an increase of polymer matrix free volume. This increase in free volume leads to an increase in permeability or to a lesser decrease than expected. This impact on free volume is often just a hypothesis that is not always confirmed experimentally, due to the difficulty to experimentally access such information.', 2: 'Such hypothesis of polymer matrix modification with increase of free volume was speculated by several authors for isodimensional particles-based composites with titanium dioxide (Matteucci et al. , Moghadam et al. ) or silica nanoparticles (Dougnac et al. , Romero et al. ) and in elongated particles-based nanocomposites with carbon nanotube (Murali et al. ). An increase of free volume was also hypothesized to occur when using compatibilizing agents due to bad compatibility between the compatibilizer and the surface treated particles (Mittal et al. ). The addition of nanoparticles in a polymer matrix could also hinder the crystallization process if chain mobility is hindered, leading thus to a decrease of the overall crystallinity of the polymer that could contribute to enhance the overall mass transfer within the composite (Dougnac et al. ).', 3: 'We noted that this increase of free volume is often considered as a global explanation resulting from different phenomena: in addition to the modification of polymer matrix, increase in free volume could also result in void space formation by nanoparticles aggregation and weak interaction between polymer-nanoparticles at interface (Moghadam et al. ). All these mechanisms are not easily distinguished. Therefore, authors stressed an overall increase of free volume that they experimentally assessed by density measurements, without distinguishing all underlying mechanisms. Indeed, if the density of the nanoparticles, crystalline polymer and amorphous polymer phases has their pure component values in the nanocomposites, then the density of a nanocomposite sample, would be equal to the theoretical additive density. The difference between theoretical and experimental densities can be rationalized by the overall increase of free volume as evidenced by (Matteucci et al. ) in spherical-based composites with titanium dioxide.'}], ['4.2.4', 'Increasing migrant sorption', {1: 'The increase of P/P <sub>0</sub> could be related to the establishment of specific interactions between the molecular penetrant and the material constituents, as largely observed for water vapor and hygroscopic nanoparticles such as silica nanoparticles (Bracho et al. , Dougnac et al. ) or microcrystalline cellulose (Dogan et al. ), and also for O <sub>2</sub> and organo-modified montmorillonite (Chang et al. ), for O <sub>2</sub> or modified silica nanoparticles (Iwata et al. ) or CO <sub>2</sub> and titanium dioxide nanoparticles (Matteucci et al. ).', 2: 'Different mechanisms could occur concomitantly, explaining why significant effects on P/P <sub>0</sub> are not systematically observed. For instance, Dogan et al.  did not notice any significant change of the water vapor permeability in hydroxyl propyl methyl cellulose/microcrystalline cellulose nanocomposites in spite of a tortuosity effect. This was ascribed to the occurrence of a competitive effect, i.e. an increased water affinity with the materials. The same happened in the study of Matteucci et al. : they observed an enhancement of CO <sub>2</sub> permeability in spherical-based composites with titanium dioxide due to an increase in gas solubility in the nanocomposite films upon incorporation of highly sorbing nanoparticles into the polymer. This effect is overlapping with the creation of voids and global increase in free volume with increasing particle loading. It should be noted that all these explanations are always hypotheses that are usually not experimentally validated.', 3: 'Fig.  is providing summary of the two previous Sections 4.1 and 4.2 with key take home messages about the main mechanisms explaining monotonic increase of decrease of the ratio P/P 0 .'}], ['4.3', 'Non-monotonic variation of P/P ', {1: 'The permeability towards gases and water vapor did not always monotonically vary. In a general manner, theories already provided above for explaining monotonic decrease or increase of P/P <sub>0</sub> remain valid in that case and apply to a specific part of the curve.', 2: 'The most observed non-monotonic variation of P/P <sub>0</sub> is first a decrease of P/P <sub>0</sub> until reaching a threshold value of filler content, followed by a sudden increase of P/P 0 . This evolution is generally ascribed to a change in the nanostructure as a function of filler content. For example, in the work of Sanchez-Garcia et al.  dealing with montmorillonite-based nanocomposites, the permeability first decreased due to a tortuosity effect and then increased for filler contents higher than 5 vol% due to the formation of agglomerates. In the case of elongated particles-based nanocomposites (Dogan et al. , Saxena et al. , Paralikar et al. ), a similar evolution was observed with the formation of particle agglomerates at higher particle volume fractions (generally &gt; 10 vol%). In addition to agglomeration that could reverse the trend of variation of P/P <sub>0</sub> , some extensive cracking of the composite film could occur and lead to a complete loss of barrier properties (Chaiko et al. ), which was attributed by the authors to excessive particle agglomeration at high particle fraction.', 3: 'An opposite evolution has been also noted in the case of water vapor as migrant: first, an increase of the water vapor permeability probably caused by enhanced affinity between water vapor and composite constituents displaying a hydrophilic nature and, second, a decrease of the permeability induced by the tortuosity that finally is sufficient enough at high loading rates to decrease the permeability value. This has been observed by Follain et al.  for poly(ε-caprolactone)/cellulose nanocrystals.'}], ['4.4', 'Explanation of the evolution of the permeability in line with the evolution of solubility and diffusivity coefficients', {1: 'In this section, it is considered that the properties of the polymer matrix are not affected by the incorporation of nanoparticles and that nanocomposites are two-phases systems with a perfect adhesion at the particle/matrix interface. This makes the relation P = D × S, where P, D and S are respectively the permeability, diffusion and solubility coefficients, valid . In order to explain the complex evolution of P/P <sub>0</sub> as a function of filler content, some authors tried to decompose the permeability into diffusivity and solubility and to relate the apparent evolution of P/P <sub>0</sub> to change in D or S or both. For that purpose, they generally determined the diffusivity and/or solubility coefficients independently of the permeability.', 2: 'In nanocomposites, a decrease in permeability should be ideally related to a decrease in both diffusivity and solubility coefficients due to the formation of a more tortuous pathway (influence on D) and to the diminution of the volume for the sorption of gases or vapors. However, this ideal case was not always observed. In most cases, solubility did not systematically decrease and tended either to remain constant or even to increase.', 3: 'For example, O <sub>2</sub> /CO <sub>2</sub> solubility was found to remain constant in poly(amide-6-b-ethylene oxide)  or brominated poly(2,6-diphenyl-1,4-phenylene oxide)  filled with silica nanoparticles while CO <sub>2</sub> solubility was found to increase with the addition of silica particles in polybenzimidazole . Despite the fact that the same nanoparticle was used in these three studies, the effect on gas solubility obtained was not. This demonstrated that if the particles could be considered as impermeable (D=0), it is not true for their solubility. As mentioned above in § 3.2, increase of S could also be related to the progressive uncovering of active sorption sites in the polymer matrix as a consequence of particle addition and to the creation of specific sites at the particle/polymer interface that favor the sorption of molecular penetrants as hypothesized by Sadeghi et al.  and Suzuki et al. .', 4: 'As regards the diffusivity coefficient, the expected behavior is a decrease due to the restriction of the motion of molecular penetrant and the creation of a more tortuous path caused by the presence of the particles . But the opposite phenomenon could also occur. Sadeghi et al. , seeking to understand the increase of the permeability in polyvinyl acetate with the addition of silica nanoparticles, made the assumption that the diffusivity coefficient could increase either due to a reduction of the packing density of the polymer which provides further open structures for the diffusion of CO <sub>2</sub> or to a reduction of the crystallinity which lead to more amorphous phases where diffusion happens. The latter effect was also hypothesized by Kono et al.  and Ahn et al.  on silica nanoparticle based nanocomposite. The diffusivity could also remain constant or increase with the addition of impermeable particles due to bad adhesion or compatibility between constituents or the creation of interconnected cavities/channels as evidenced by Suzuki et al. , Kim et al.  and Cong et al. .', 5: 'To sum up, following analysis of all aforementioned experimental evidences, we can conclude that there is generally a competition between an increase of the solubility and a decrease of the diffusivity. Therefore, non-monotonic changes of P/P <sub>0</sub> , in peculiar, decrease of P/ P <sub>0</sub> followed by an increase for higher particle volume fraction, could be generally ascribed to an increase of S that could, from a threshold value of particle volume fraction, counteract the decrease of D.'}], ['4.5', 'Discussion of the selective transport characteristics of nanocomposite membranes', {1: 'In the context of developing barrier films, it is also interesting to Fig. .

It is indeed of high interest in many applications to develop nanocomposites that are designed to provide a very strong barrier to one component (for instance oxygen) while remaining permeable to another (such as carbon dioxide or water vapor). In this purpose, CO <sub>2</sub> / O <sub>2</sub> selectivity and H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity were calculated, when possible, from the data gathered in the framework of this study and plotted as a function of the nanoparticle volume fraction (Figs. ). In most of cases, CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> and H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity was not initially in the objective of the original works used to derive it. Therefore, it was not systematically possible to calculate it from the permeability data available per reference. It must be noted that for the sake of clarity, for H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity, the ratio of nanocomposite selectivity to neat polymer selectivity is used in Fig.  while absolute values of PCO <sub>2</sub> /PO <sub>2</sub> are directly plotted in Fig. , because they display less range of variation.', 2: 'As it can be seen in Fig. , and in the logic of result of the Fig.  analysis, there are much more data of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity available for layered particles than for iso-dimensional particles and elongated ones where only four references have permitted to calculate this value. It is thus not possible to draw meaningful conclusions about the evolution of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity for elongated nanoparticles-based nanocomposites (Fig. ).', 3: 'Logically, CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity of layered particles-based nanocomposites was centered around a mean value of 4, which is usually the permselectivity of oil-based polymers used as neat matrix in most of the studies (Fig. ).

Two studies nevertheless lead to an increase of the CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity as a function of nanoparticle volume fraction . In the work of Meera et al. , the decrease of permeability as a function of filler content is much higher for O <sub>2</sub> than for CO <sub>2</sub> leading to an increase of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permeability ratio while it seems to be the contrary for Merinska et al. . In the same time and for another combination of filler/polymer (Nanofill 5 as MMT/PP), the data of Merinska et al.  permitted to obtain a decrease of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity. Alena et al.  also observed either an increase or decrease of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity depending on the type of nanoparticle (MMT) used in LDPE matrix. These last features confirm the random nature of the evolution of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity as a function of nanoparticle volume fraction. We noted that this notion of permselectivity and its evolution as a function of filler content was never explained nor even highlighted by the aforementioned group of authors.', 4: 'For isodimensional particles-based nanocomposites, the CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity is also centered around a value of 5 (Fig. ) and kept almost constant as a function of filler volume fraction. Nevertheless, a group of 5 studies displays very high CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity (&gt; 15). Among this group of studies, we noted a general trend toward an increase of permselectivity with nanoparticle volume fraction (4 studies  observing an increase against only one  observing a decrease). Variation of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity in the aforementioned studies was principally due to the fact that O <sub>2</sub> and CO <sub>2</sub> permeability did not decrease as much as a function of filler content resulting in a nonconstant PCO <sub>2</sub> /PO <sub>2</sub> ratio. Results of Zoppi et al.  and Kim et al.  with high CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity were obtained on PEBAX® (copolymer with polyamide-6 and poly(ethyleneoxide)) which is known to display high CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> selectivity in packaging application. These authors did not try to explain why the CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity varied in their sample: Kim et al.  focused only on CO <sub>2</sub> /He, CO <sub>2</sub> /N <sub>2</sub> and O <sub>2</sub> /N <sub>2</sub> selectivity and did not notice any variation of these selectivities as a function of nanoparticle volume fraction (about 6 for CO <sub>2</sub> /He, 70 for CO <sub>2</sub> /N <sub>2</sub> and 3 for O <sub>2</sub> /N <sub>2</sub> respectively); Zoppi et al.  focusing on O <sub>2</sub> / N <sub>2</sub> , CO <sub>2</sub> /CH <sub>4</sub> , CO <sub>2</sub> /N <sub>2</sub> and CO <sub>2</sub> /H <sub>2</sub> selectivity did not notice so much variation of this value as a function of nanoparticle content except for very high volume ratio (15 vol/vol%). Only Semsarzadeh et al.  calculated the CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity in their study on polyurethane-silica/polyvinyl alcohol mixed matrix membranes. They noticed that by increasing the silica content in membranes, all gas permselectivities including CO <sub>2</sub> , namely CO <sub>2</sub> /N <sub>2</sub> , CO <sub>2</sub> /CH <sub>4</sub> and CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> increased much more than selectivity including other gases such as O <sub>2</sub> / N <sub>2</sub> , up to 136%, 69% and 47%, respectively. They explained that, while O <sub>2</sub> , N <sub>2</sub> and CH <sub>4</sub> displayed decreasing permeability, CO <sub>2</sub> permeability demonstrated an increase upon increasing silica content due to an increase in the number of the active sites (polar OH groups) for gas dissolution in polymer matrix. The same reduced decrease in CO <sub>2</sub> permeability compared to other gases such as O <sub>2</sub> or N <sub>2</sub> was observed by Sadeghi et al.  in polyether-based polyurethane-silica and polyurethane-silica nanocomposite leading to moderate increase of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> selectivity as a function of nanoparticle content (Fig. ).', 5: 'The comparative examination of permeability and selectivity variation of data collected in the database considered in this work is now in order. Indeed, for the case of inclusion of impermeable particles in a permeable polymer matrix, the anticipated mechanism of induced tortuosity in path of gas molecules is expected to reduce the permeability of different gases by the same extent. A further analysis was thus performed to explore possible correlation between relative permeability and permselectivity in the available set of data. The examination is confined to the case of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> selectivity in nanocomposite obtained from the inclusion of isodimensional or platelet shaped nanoparticles, as only for those cases is a sufficient number of data available to insure the significance of the statistical analysis. In Fig.  the relative permeability for CO <sub>2</sub> in the nanocomposites is related to the corresponding square variation of permselectivity δ defined as follows:', 6: 'where α <sub>NC</sub> and α <sub>M</sub> are CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity in nanocomposite and neat matrix, respectively. Despite the scattering, data in Fig.  put in evidence that, both for the case of isodimensional particles and platelets, relative permeability higher than one is typically accompanied by a significant deviation of nanocomposite permselectivity from the value of neat matrix, while an interval exists for relative permeability of nanocomposite moderately lower than 1, for which the deviation in permselectivity from the value of neat matrix is negligible. Significantly, the above interval for relative permeability extends to lower values for the case of nanocomposites including platelets with respect to the case of isodimensional particles. It can be thus concluded that a good number of studies considered in this work shows results which are at least qualitatively consistent with the picture resulting from the tortuosity effect induced by the dispersed phase to the motion of gas molecules. On the other hand, a large number of nanocomposites exhibiting either relative permeability values higher than one or very low seems to be often characterized by significant variation of the permselectivity, indicating the relevance of additional phenomena hiding the effect of a pure increase in tortuosity path for the motion of gas molecules in the system. As it can be seen in Fig. , data available to calculate H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity are much scarcer than for CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> and, for this reason, the correlation between relative permeability and deviation of permselectivity is not discussed here for this kind of data. No values were even found in the collected references for calculated H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity in iso-dimensional nanoparticle based nanocomposites. Only three references were found for elongated ones. O <sub>2</sub> permeability is rarely investigated concomitantly to H <sub>2</sub> O permeability although H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity is a very important value in many applications such as packaging where sometimes a high barrier property to O <sub>2</sub> is required at the same time as low barrier to H <sub>2</sub> 0. From Fig. , it can be concluded that the H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity did not vary so much as a function of nanoparticle volume fraction except for the study of Kasirga et al. , Chang et al.  and Lee et al.  where H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity tended to dramatically increase then decrease for at least Chang et al.  and Lee et al. . Even if none of these authors intentionally measured nor explained the evolution of H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity, this behavior could be generally ascribed to a better tortuosity effect obtained for H <sub>2</sub> O than for O <sub>2</sub> and, for non-monotonic behavior, to nonlinear decrease in permeability with clay loading.', 7: 'To conclude about the selective transport characteristics of nanocomposites membranes, the previous analysis has highlighted that a correlation exists between permeability and the corresponding selectivity value which could be used to emphasize that deviations from expected behavior for selectivity (either positive or negative variation of selectivity) are often associated with deviations from expected behavior for permeability (very high reduction or increase).'}], ['5', 'Conclusion', {1: 'The recently-measured values of gas (O <sub>2</sub> , CO <sub>2</sub> ) and water vapor permeability in agro-, bio-and synthetic-based nanocomposites have been comprehensively reviewed with emphases on the link between their micro-and nano-structure and their barrier performance.', 2: 'This review has revealed that despite numerous and intensive studies on the optimization of nanocomposite processing and structure in the perspective of modulating their barrier properties, the expected decreasing effect on the permeability is often not so high as expected and sometimes completely the opposite. This review confirmed that layered nanoparticles are more efficient than isodimensional and elongated nanoparticles to decrease the relative permeability (P/P <sub>0</sub> ). But, this effect is difficult to anticipate due to numerous interfering mechanisms that provoke modifications of tortuosity, sorption, polymer matrix (crystallinity, free volume, molar mass), creation of an interphase, voids and cracks, and more that lead to unexpected behaviors of the permeability in nanocomposites. Investigation of the selective transport of CO <sub>2</sub> to O <sub>2</sub> and H <sub>2</sub> 0 to O <sub>2</sub> did not reveal a general trend either and it is also difficult to anticipate.', 3: 'It was concluded that tortuosity, the main mechanism proposed to explain permeability decrease in nanocomposites, often fails in explaining the effect of nanoparticles on nanocomposite barrier properties. This is particularly important knowing that most of the mathematical models used to predict permeability in nanocomposites are based on this tortuosity effect.'}]]\n"

It is well known that inclusion of homogeneously dispersed and oriented impermeable fillers with high aspect ratio, such as platelets or elongated particles, should significantly increase the diffusion path of gas and vapors and yield to improve barrier properties. Results revealed that this expected impact was not systematically achieved, even for impermeable lamellar fillers that usually displayed the highest aspect ratio. More specifically, an unexpected increase of the permeability in the nanocomposite was often observed. To explain this deviation of the 'ideal behavior', this paper discusses extensively the impact of the nanoparticle shape on the nanocomposite permeability along with structural aspects, related to both the particle nature and size, and the nanocomposite processing routes. Deviations from expected results of enhanced barrier effect are also discussed in correlation with unexpected variations in gas selectivity for O 2 /CO 2 pair. Lastly, this review aims at drawing meaningful conclusions on the structure/mass transfer relationships and giving directions for the development of the next generation of packaging materials with tailored mass transfer properties.\"}], ['1', 'Introduction', {1: 'In the objective of developing efficient and optimal packaging, one of the main challenges is to design and provide food packaging materials able to protect the food from the external environment and to maintain food quality and safety throughout its shelf life . The mass transfers are thus at the heart of the feature of the food packaging, especially transfers of water vapor, oxygen and/or carbon dioxide, which condition the rates of numerous reactions of food degradation (oxidation, microbial development, physiological reactions, etc.). The development of bulk nanocomposite structures by introducing nanoparticles, i.e. fillers having at least one dimension lower than 100 nm, in polymeric matrices appeared as one of the most promising directions in the development of packaging materials with advanced mass transfer properties. The expected role of these inclusions is to achieve a significant decrease of the mass transfer properties as compared to the neat matrix by acting as physical obstacles to the diffusion and permeation of diffusing molecules, which have to follow a more tortuous pathway. This phenomenon is called the tortuosity effect.', 2: 'Many types of nanoparticles have already been tested to modulate mass transfer properties, with hundreds of permeability data published in literature. Nanoparticles can be classified into three major categories according to their particle shape (Fig. ): (i) isodimensional particles, that have the same size in all directions and an aspect ratio close to unity (such as spherical silica, TiO <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles, carbon black and fullerenes); (ii) elongated particles that consist in fibrils with a diameter ranging between 1 and 100 nm and length up to several hundred nanometers (such as carbon nanotubes or cellulose nanofibers); and (iii) layered particles that are characterized by one dimension ranging from several angstroms to several nanometers (such as layered silicates or starch nanocrystals). Among the three aforementioned types of particles, it is widely recognized that inclusion of impermeable platelets such as clays in the polymer should significantly enhance its barrier properties. However, an in-depth study of the available data in the literature revealed that it was not systematically the case and, even, on the contrary could lead to a deterioration of the barrier properties. Many reviews deal with the functional properties of nanocomposites, by mainly focusing on mechanical properties . Among these studies, some of them focused slightly on the mass transfer properties  but without deepening the topic. These studies generally focused on one type of nanoparticle, i.e. spherical nanoparticles or nano-platelets for instance, particularly for membrane applications. Few of them focused on food packaging applications . The last exhaustive review in the field is that of Cui et al.  that focused on gas barrier properties of clay-based polymer nanocomposites. However, the effect of the platelet-shape has never been compared and discussed along with results obtained with spherical and elongated particle shape. In spite of all these preceding reviews, there is still a huge lack of analysis of all available data in the perspective of deciphering the role of particle shape on the mass transfer properties of the resulting nanocomposite materials, even if it has been highlighted as a key input parameter in mathematical models. As far as we knew, there is no review that proposes an exhaustive analysis of the experimental permeability values from the available literature.', 3: 'In order to better correlate the mass transfer properties in nanocomposite materials with their multi-scale structure, the objective of the present review is to decipher and comprehensively discuss the role of the nanoparticle shape (either isodimensional, elongated or layered) on the modulation of the mass transfer properties in nanocomposites, as a function of filler volume fraction and in the light of the nanocomposite structure achieved. For that purpose, more than 1000 values (i.e. about 170 articles) of the 1995-2015 period containing measured values of O <sub>2</sub> , CO <sub>2</sub> and H <sub>2</sub> O permeability in polymer-based nanocomposites were collected from the available literature and capitalized in a dedicated on-line database . All data could be uploaded from the permalink provided in figure caption (https://doi.org/10.5281/ zenodo.1136269). The proposed on-line database consists in the first and unprecedented compilation of permeability values for nanocomposite based materials. The current work is focused on direct analysis and comparison of experiments, without any mediation which could be provided by quantitative models. It must be specified that, in order to build up the database for analysis, which is of interest here, recent data for gas barrier in polymer based materials with dispersed graphene and graphene derivatives were not taken into consideration. In fact, while the latter represent nanocomposite materials with dispersed layered domains, the extremely high aspect ratio and flexibility of graphene layers reduces the threshold value for percolation in these materials to much lower values than in traditional layered particles nanocomposites . Under those conditions, in the volume concentration range for layered particles which is of reference in this work (in the order of 10% by volume) layers arrangement and layer defects are significantly more relevant to the barrier effect than the aspect ratio (particle shape) itself. For a comparison between gas barrier properties in polymer/clay and polymer/graphene nanocomposite see the review by Tan . For the above reason, although graphene has attracted much attention in recent years for the production of polymer based composites for packaging, analysis of pertinent results for gas barrier properties is left to a different discussion and the interested reader is addressed to recent reviews in the field .', 4: 'Besides the meaningful conclusions on the role of nanoparticle shape, the main output of this paper is to give some recommendations for the design of nanocomposite packaging materials with tunable mass transfer properties.'}], ['2', 'Brief overview of nanocomposites processing and morphologies', {1: 'All the processes used to prepare polymer-based nanocomposites have already been extensively detailed in dedicated reviews and are not further detailed here. Examples of reference publications for layered silicates-based nanocomposites are those of Alexandre &amp; Dubois , Ray et al. , Pavlidou et al. , Mittal et al.  and Cui et al. , for natural fibre-based nanocomposites, those of Saheb et al.  and Siqueira et al.  and for inorganic spherical particle-based nanocomposites, those of Cong et al.  and Chung et al. . Due to the large range of polymer matrices and nanoparticles, different processing routes have been proposed to produce nanocomposites based on their convenience according to the nature of the raw constituents and their field of application (Fig. ). At laboratory scale, four main processes are most commonly used to prepare polymer-based nanocomposites from all the types of nanoparticles. Melt processing and solution blending are two processes based on the use of polymers, which lead to the formation of Van der Waals interactions between the constituents, while insitu polymerization and sol/gel methods are based on the use of monomers or oligomers, leading to the formation of covalent bonds between the polymer and the nanoparticles (Fig. ). At industrial scale, melt processing is generally preferred due to the difficulty to implement processes requiring the use of huge volumes of solvent.', 2: 'Depending on the processing conditions, the particle shape and the affinity between constituents, i.e. the polymer matrix and the nanoparticle, different morphologies can be obtained. For isodimensional and elongated nanoparticles, three arrangements can be observed, i.e. (i) well-dispersed, (ii) agglomerated, or (iii) percolating systems. For platelets, specific names are given to the various possible morphologies: (i) micro-composite, (ii) intercalated nanocomposite or (iii) fully exfoliated nanocomposites. The micro-composite structure corresponds to '}], ['3', 'Effect of the nanoparticle shape on the modulation of mass transfer properties', {}], ['3.1', 'Theoretical background', {1: 'A great amount of effort has been made in the literature to describe the effect on transport properties of the inclusion of non-conducting particles into a conductive matrix and the effect of particle shape has been a focus since the beginning of these studies. Similar analyses of the problem can be found in the field of electrical properties (electrical conductivity/permittivity) as well as in that of heat or mass transfer (thermal conductivity/mass diffusivity). Exact solutions in terms of effective conductivity of the composite medium have been obtained already by Maxwell in 1873  for the case of dilute mixture of spherical domains (\"non-interacting particles\") perfectly adhering to the matrix. These exact solutions assume that the properties of dispersed and continuous phase in the composite are the same than the one measured in the corresponding pure materials (\"ideal interface condition\").', 2: 'Wiener  in 1912 extended the results to the case of dilute dispersion of long cylinders in the matrix, all aligned in the direction normal to the overall flux. While exact solutions are also available for the case of spheroids (dilute mixture, perfect alignment), empirical relations as well as numerical result have been discussed for the case of different shapes of the inclusions. Among the best, known results of this kind are those obtained by Nielsen  in 1967 following empirical ideas about the increase in contour length of path of diffusing molecules in the composite medium due to the presence of impermeable inclusions in the form of bricks. The specific expression for effective conductivity as function of particle concentration in the composite as derived from the above models is not here presented and discussed, as the direct comparison of available experimental results with model predictions is not relevant to this work. On the other hand, it is useful to remember here that all the above approaches consistently predict a decrease in the conductivity when the concentration of impermeable particles in the composite increases. In general terms, it can be said that, assuming ideal interface and non-interacting particle condition, the effective conductivity of the composite medium is expected to be half the value of the pure matrix when the concentration of dispersed phase approaches 40% vol for isometric particles, 30% vol for elongated particles aligned normally to the flux, and a much lower value, only few percent, depending on the exact shape, for layered particles lying in planes orthogonal to the flux.', 3: 'It should be finally mentioned that more complex analyses are definitely needed to consider the interaction between particles in the medium (concentrated mixtures), the distribution in their orientation, as well the non-ideal interaction with the matrix which can ultimately result in regions close to the interface with properties different from that of pure materials .

All these papers, dealing with nanocomposite materials, presented at least one value of permeability in relation to their composition. The nanoparticles considered in works examined in this review are those assumed as impermeable and non-porous with respect to the application that is focused on: barrier membranes mainly for packaging application. Moreover, it must be noted that mass transfer does not follow the same mechanisms in dense and porous material and that mixing porous and non-porous materials may disturb the analysis. Only gases (O <sub>2</sub> and CO <sub>2</sub> ) and water vapor permeability data were considered because of their high interest for food packaging applications. These data were analyzed as regard to the particle shape (isodimensional, elongated, or platelet), the filler volume fraction, the eventual chemical and functionalization treatments applied to the nanoparticle and the elaboration technique used to prepare materials. The main characteristics of the nanocomposites studied in the present review are gathered in Tables 1-3.', 2: 'In the following, the evolution of the relative permeability, i.e. the ratio of the composite permeability to the permeability of the neat matrix (P/P <sub>0</sub> ), was represented as a function of the nanoparticle volume fraction (φ <sub>vol</sub> ), which is considered as input parameter in all mathematical models.

All of them have been represented in Fig.  leading to a scatter graph in which each individual study could not, of course, be distinguished. For comparison, 45 publications were found for isodimensional nanoparticles-based nanocomposites against 22 for elongated nanoparticles-based nanocomposites, resulting in about 380 and 120 permeability values respectively (Fig. ). Papers dealing with elongated particle displaying micrometric sizes (13 papers more) were voluntary excluded from this review. Due to the high number of studies found for each type of particle shape (for O <sub>2</sub> , CO <sub>2</sub> and H <sub>2</sub> O permeability), the figures are overloaded and thus not easily readable. Three complementary figures have been drawn for each type of particle shape and for each molecule studied, i.e. O <sub>2</sub> , H <sub>2</sub> O and CO <sub>2</sub> respectively. Analysis of these general figures permits to highlight the intensive work on the topic and to draw the general tendencies of P/P <sub>0</sub> variation as a function of nanoparticle shape and φ <sub>vol</sub> and nature of the penetrant.

Only 3 publications (i.e. 11 permeability values) were in the range of 15-40 vol% for nanoplatelets-based nanocomposites (not shown in Fig. ). This feature could be ascribed to the fact that usually, only a small weight fraction of nanoplatelets (generally 1-5 wt%) is necessary to obtain a significant effect on the material functional properties.', 3: '• <super>The</super> <super>evolution</super> <super>and</super> <super>variation</super> <super>amplitude</super> <super>of</super> <super>P/P</super> <super>0</super> <super>as</super> <super>a</super> <super>function</super> <super>of</super> <super>the</super> nanoparticle volume fraction is really complex and does not follow the same trend according to the shape of nanoparticles (Fig. ).

This leads to a scatter graph of P/P <sub>0</sub> with a general aspect in herringbones centered on P/P <sub>0</sub> = 1.

This could be easily ascribed to the particle geometry and the more pronounced tortuosity effect induced by platelets as compared to spheres or cylinders. To go further, an in-depth, quantitative analysis of the data collected and capitalized was carried out.'}], ['3.4', 'In-depth analysis of the modulation of mass transfer properties per type of nanoparticle', {1: 'In order to perform a quantitative analysis of the efficiency of each type of nanoparticle shape on P/P <sub>0</sub> , all the permeability data collected in the literature were gathered on a histogram displaying the percentage of values per class of modulation, i.e. per range of P/P <sub>0</sub> values. The maximum number of permeability values collected for isodimensional (43%), elongated (29%) and layered (30%) nanoparticles is obtained for the classes 1 &lt; P/P <sub>0</sub> &lt; 2, 1 &lt; P/P <sub>0</sub> &lt; 2, and 0.6 &lt; P/P <sub>0</sub> &lt; 0.8 respectively, confirming that layered nanoparticles were more prone to improve the barrier properties of a given polymer (Fig. ).', 2: 'Besides this main impact, secondary peaks are observed on Fig. . In the case of isodimensional nanoparticles, 17% of values are obtained for the class 2 &lt; P/P <sub>0</sub> &lt; 3 and 14% for 0.8 &lt; P/P <sub>0</sub> &lt; 1, indicating that the permeability in these nanocomposites could be equally multiplied by a factor of 3 or slightly decreased by a factor of 0.8. This feature confirms well the herringbone scatter graph observed when all P/P <sub>0</sub> data are plotted as a function of φ <sub>vol</sub> (Fig. ).', 3: 'In the case of elongated nanoparticles, 17% of collected data belong to the class 0.6 &lt; P/P <sub>0</sub> &lt; 0.8 and another 17% to the class 0.8 &lt; P/ P <sub>0</sub> &lt; 1. This indicated that even if the main observed effect of the addition of elongated nanoparticles is a weak increase of permeability up to a factor 2, it could also statistically lead to a decrease of the permeability.', 4: 'In the case of layered nanoparticles, the overall trend of decreasing permeability is confirmed by the occurrence of secondary peaks, which reveals that 23% of permeability values were obtained for 0.4 &lt; P/P <sub>0</sub> 0.6 and 21% for 0.8 &lt; P/P <sub>0</sub> &lt; 1. In all the cases, P/P <sub>0</sub> values higher than 3 are very rare (less than 6% of the studies for every particle shape).', 5: 'To verify if the conclusions drawn from this global analysis were confirmed for all the tested filler contents, permeability values were also apportioned into classes of filler volume fraction in addition to the classes of P/P <sub>0</sub> values (Fig. ). The classes chosen for filler fractions were 0-5 vol%, 5-10 vol%, 10-20 vol% and 20-30 vol%. For this analysis, the range for P/P <sub>0</sub> was limited to a maximal value of 3, considering that a higher increase of the permeability ratio was an exceptional behavior. In the case of isodimensional nanoparticles, exactly the same evolution of P/P <sub>0</sub> is obtained for each filler fraction, with an Fig. .

For elongated nanoparticles, the same increase of P/P <sub>0</sub> is obtained but only for filler contents lower than 20 vol%. For higher filler contents, no clear tendency is evidenced, with a disordered shape of the curve. This could be due to agglomerated or percolated structures that become frequent for such high concentration in fillers whose effect on permeability is more unpredictable (Fig. ). Finally, for nanoplatelets-based nanocomposites, for filler contents lower than 5 vol%, the evolution of P/P <sub>0</sub> is the same as the general one previously observed on Fig.  and is characterized by a main peak (30% of data) centered on the class 0.6-0.8. This main peak shifts to lower P/P <sub>0</sub> values, i.e. better efficiency, for filler contents ranging from 5 to 10 vol%, with a main peak (38%) for P/P <sub>0</sub> values in the range of 0.4-0.6. For filler content higher than 10 vol%, the decrease in permeability is not confirmed anymore. We noted that studies conducted with such high amounts of platelets (&gt; 10 vol%) were scarce, which makes it difficult to generalize the effect of high contents of platelets on the permeability of resulting nanocomposites (Fig. ).', 6: 'To sum up, beyond the fact that modulation of the permeability is clearly affected by the shape of the nanoparticles, three conclusions (i) whatever the filler content, the addition of isodimensional particles does not statistically impact the permeability of resulting nanocomposites very much, (ii) a significant decrease of permeability could be achieved by nanostructuring polymer matrices with the introduction of either elongated or nanoplatelets-shaped nanoparticles, with a much higher efficiency of layered nanoparticles. Indeed, the use of filler contents higher than 20 vol% are necessary to achieve a significant decrease of P/P <sub>0</sub> in the case of elongated nanoparticles while less than 10 vol% are sufficient in the case of nanoplatelets, (iii) the barrier effect of nanoplatelets is even more pronounced for filler contents ranging from 5 to 10 vol%.', 7: 'This analysis has also revealed that the behavior of P/P <sub>0</sub> is more complex than expected, with the occurrence of non-monotonic behaviors, especially in the case of elongated nanoparticles.

For the sake of clarity, the exhaustive list of these references is in footnote. <super>1</super> The amplitude of this decrease largely depends on the particle shape and/or particle volume fraction used. The authors mainly attributed this result to (1) a tortuosity effect induced by the nanostructure created by the incorporation of an impermeable particle, and to a lesser extent to (2) the modification of the polymer matrix properties by the presence of nanoparticles, or (3) the modification of the availability of specific sorption sites for the sorption of the diffusing molecule. These three assumptions will be discussed in the following paragraphs.'}], ['4.1.1', 'Tortuosity effect', {1: 'When impermeable nanoparticles are incorporated within a polymer matrix, they act as an obstacle to the diffusion and thus the permeation of diffusing molecules, which have to follow a more tortuous pathway. Mathematically, tortuosity (τ) represents the ratio of the distance that a molecular specie must follow through the nanocomposite thickness to the distance through the neat polymer.', 2: 'This tortuosity effect is influenced by the volume fraction and the  <super>1</super> Among studies that observed a decrease of P/P <sub>0</sub> , we can cite the following papers:', 3: 'For spherical particles: dispersion and distribution states of nanoparticles within the polymer matrix. Concretely, it could be related to two quantitative parameters, i.e. the in-situ size aspect ratio of the particle and the orientation of nanoparticles.', 4: '4.1.1.1. In-situ particle aspect ratio. The size aspect ratio of a nanoparticle is defined as the ratio of its longest dimension to its lowest dimension. Considering the different possible shapes of nanoparticles, it is obvious that the size aspect ratio of a sphere, equal to 1, is lower than that of elongated nanoparticles and nanoplatelets for which very high size aspect ratio could be achieved. The achievement of high size aspect ratios theoretically favors the establishment of a more tortuous pathway. This effect is all the greater for nanoplatelets that allow the creation of 2D obstacles. This has been experimentally validated by Gatos et al.  who prepared by melt processing fully-exfoliated nanocomposites from a hydrogenated acrylonitrile butadiene rubber polymer and two layered silicates displaying different sizes, i.e. octadecylamine modified montmorillonites with a size aspect ratio of 100 and synthetic fluorohectorite with a size aspect ratio of 200. They observed that the highest decrease of oxygen permeability was achieved using the fluorohectorite as filler, which was ascribed to its higher aspect ratio . It must be noted that the achievement of such high in-situ size aspect ratios is exceptional. Indeed, the formation of stacks or tactoïds within the polymer matrix is usually obtained due to the agglomeration and/or incomplete exfoliation of nanoplatelets, resulting in a decrease of the theoretical size aspect ratio. An intercalated nanocomposite structure is thus less tortuous than a full-exfoliated structure. This implies that the in-situ size aspect ratio is usually different from the one of the native nanoparticle. As an example, Angellier-Coussy et al.  found average values of in-situ size aspect ratio of 17 and 23 for 10.8 and 2.2 vol% of filler, respectively in wheat gluten/montmorillonite based nanocomposites while the size aspect ratio of one native nanoparticle was about 80. This issue is the same for elongated nanoparticles where agglomeration often occurs.', 5: 'In practice, the knowledge of the in-situ size aspect ratio is thus necessary to fully understand and predict the impact of tortuosity on mass transfer properties. It is usually evaluated using image analysis of TEM pictures when nanoparticles can be easily distinguished from the matrix as is the case for montmorillonite . This analysis is tricky and time consuming. Indeed, a large number of images must be analyzed to obtain a significant representativeness of the whole material. In addition, it is well-known that TEM analysis has some inherent limitations due to the fact that it projects three-dimensional (3D) objects onto a two-dimensional (2D) plane, resulting in TEM cross-sections that do not necessarily represent the actual size of all the platelets . Furthermore, an ideal image would exhibit sharp transitions from black to white, what is not the case in reality, necessitating the conversion of the original grey-scale TEM micrograph into a black and white image using a semi-automated approach, this step being inevitably accompanied by errors. And finally, this evaluation must be done for each filler content, since the dispersion state strongly depends on the filler content. All these limitations probably explain why the evaluation of the in-situ size aspect ratio is rarely experimentally determined. It is usually an imprecise, unrealistic (if the size aspect ratio of the native nanoparticle is considered) or missing data.', 6: '4.1.1.2. In-situ size aspect ratio and dispersion state. As explained above, the in-situ aspect ratio strongly depends on the particle dispersion state. Contrary to the in-situ size aspect ratio, which is rarely determined, the impact of the particle dispersion state on nanocomposite mass transfer properties has been largely demonstrated. For example, Koh et al.  demonstrated with PLA/organo-modified montmorillonites nanocomposites that the highest decrease of the oxygen and carbon dioxide permeability was obtained for the most exfoliated structure. The same positive impact of exfoliation on permeability decrease was also obtained by Sanchez-Garcia et al.  in PHBV-PCL nanocomposites and by Sun et al.  for α-zirconium phosphate/ epoxy resin nanocomposites.', 7: 'It is worth noting that the achievement of a good dispersion state is all the more difficult as the filler content increases due to agglomeration phenomena, as evidenced in many systems such as agar-(Rhim et al. ), polyester-(Bharadwaj et al. ), polyamide-(Picard et al. ) or polyimide-(Chang et al. ) based nanocomposites with montmorillonite as nanoparticles. Chemical modification of nanoparticles does not always prevent agglomeration, as evidenced by Zhu et al.  with modified SiO <sub>2</sub> particles in poly (vinyl chloride) matrix.', 8: '4.1.1.3. Orientation. To obtain an optimal decreasing effect on permeability, the largest surface of each nanoparticle must be oriented perpendicular to the direction of the gas diffusion or permeation. Well-oriented and aligned particles perpendicularly to the permeation flux have more impact on the decrease of the permeability than disoriented particles as regards the tortuosity effect. This effect of orientation is only valid for elongated particles and nanoplatelets and, of course, all the more significant for particles with high size aspect ratios. This effect of orientation is also theoretically much more efficient for nanoparticles displaying high size aspect ratio in two dimensions (such as platelets) than only in one dimension (such as elongated particles). In practice, it is an extremely challenging task to achieve a regular arrangement of nanoparticles within the polymer matrix. It is strongly dependent on processing methods. Solution intercalation and in-situ-polymerization are more prone to produce nanostructures with well-aligned and oriented particles than melt intercalation as observed by several authors. It is all the more difficult that particles display high aspect ratio in 2dimension such as platelets. For example, Messersmith et al.  showed that montmorillonites adopted a planar orientation in the poly (ε-caprolactone) polymer matrix after in-situ-polymerization and solution casting processing while Sanchez-Garcia et al.  noted that it was difficult to obtain, using melt processing and compression moulding, well aligned and oriented montmorillonites in PHBV-PCL polymer and that a random orientation is at best the most often achieved.'}], ['4.1.2', 'Modification of the polymer matrix', {1: 'The incorporation of nanoparticles can modify the structure and thus the mass transfer properties of the polymer matrix itself. The two main structural modifications reported to contribute to the decrease of P/P <sub>0</sub> are (i) a reduction of polymer free volume associated to an increase in the glass transition temperature and/or (ii) an increase in crystallinity due to a nucleating effect of nanoparticles. The effect of polymer free volume was for example evidenced in the study of Sadeghi et al.  by a reduction of the polymer chain mobility in the amorphous phase in the case of polyurethane-silica nanocomposites. The impact of nanoparticles on polymer crystallinity was largely reported for either spherical particles such as silica nanoparticles (Vladimirov et al. ; Vassiliou et al. ) or layered particles such as montmorillonite (Sanchez-Garcia et al. ; Ghasemi et al. ). Crystallites act as obstacles to migrant diffusion.'}], ['4.1.3', 'Decrease of polymer sorption sites', {1: 'The chemical modification of the nanoparticle surface is generally performed to reach a better filler/matrix affinity and thus a better dispersion of nanofillers within the polymer matrix. A side effect of this higher affinity is a decrease of the availability of the sorption sites in the polymer. It is particularly true for highly interactive molecules such as water vapor that interacts though hydrogen bonding with hydrophilic sites. These sites bonded with the nanoparticles are not any more available for water sorption. Such changes in specific interactions between the migrant and the polymer were proposed to explain the decrease of water vapor permeability observed by Tunc et al.  in wheat gluten/montmorillonite or by Lee et al.  in soy protein/ montmorillonite nanocomposites.'}], ['4.2', 'Monotonic increase of the permeability', {1: 'Several assumptions are proposed in literature to explain either the absence of significant modification or even an increase of the permeability in nanocomposites: (1) an insufficient tortuosity effect, (2) the occurrence of macroscopic structural defects in the nanocomposite material induced for instance by particles agglomeration, (3) a significant modification of the structure of the polymer matrix such as a decrease of crystallinity or molecular weight, and (4) an increase of migrant sorption induced by nanoparticles (case of water vapor for example, for water sensitive materials). It is worth noting that some mechanisms assumed to explain an increase of P/P <sub>0</sub> were previously discussed for explaining a decrease of P/P <sub>0</sub> (Section 3.1).'}], ['4.2.1', 'Lack of tortuosity effect', {1: 'In some cases, the dispersion state of nanoparticles did not allow to achieve a sufficient tortuosity effect to slow down the diffusion of migrating molecules, especially for small molecules such as gases. Such an explanation is widely proposed to explain why values of permeability did not change or only slightly decreased in the nanocomposite as compared to the neat matrix. This has been, for example, proposed by Tunc et al.  to explain the constancy of O <sub>2</sub> permeability in wheat gluten/montmorillonite nanocomposites. In the same article, authors however demonstrated that the achieved tortuosity was nevertheless sufficient for decreasing permeability of bigger molecules such as aroma compounds. This highlighted that the nature, molecular weight and/or steric hindrance of the migrant are also key parameters governing the mass transfer properties in nanocomposites. 4.2.2. Macroscopic structural defects 4.2.2.1. Particle agglomeration. The presence of both nano-or microsized agglomerates and aggregates of particles could induce macroscopic structural defects, which play a major role in the increase of P/P <sub>0</sub> , as already shown for either spherical-based composites with SiO <sub>2</sub> (Cornelius et al. ), TiO <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (Zoppi et al. ) or cylinder-based composites with cellulose fibrils (Bilbao-Sainz et al. ). These agglomeration phenomena are related to a bad dispersion of the nanoparticles which is mainly ascribed to (1) mismatching of the particle polarity, as compared to that of the polymer, resulting in a low affinity between constituents and thus a poor particle/polymer adhesion  and/or (2) inefficiency of the elaboration technique to separate aggregates.', 2: 'For example, insufficient shearing forces during the melt processing could cause agglomeration of particles. During casting, sol-gel method and in-situ polymerization, coalescence of the particles during drying of the solution could appear through insufficient particle/particle interactions (\"bad compatibility\"). This last phenomenon is normally limited by chemical modification of the surface of the particles. But when the effect of this chemical modification is wrongly anticipated it could even amplify/trigger coalescence of particles as evidenced by Zhu et al.  in their study of H <sub>2</sub> 0 and O <sub>2</sub> permeability of silica/PVC nanocomposites with SiO <sub>2</sub> surface grafted with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). They noticed that high content of filling (&gt; 2.5 vol/vol%) increased the permeability of both O <sub>2</sub> and H <sub>2</sub> 0 due to an agglomeration phenomenon owing to the tendency of nanoscale silica modified nanoparticles to be fused together at this concentration. This phenomenon was not anticipated.', 3: 'Agglomeration could lead to the formation of \"interfacial voids\" at the particle/polymer matrix interface and to the formation of a preferential pathway for the migration of the molecular penetrant (Ismail et al. , Rafiq et al. ). This is further detailed below in the section dedicated to the \"interphase\". 4.2.2.2. Interphase. An interphase, i.e. a \"third compartment\" with its own properties, is generated at the particles/polymer interface due to the establishment of either weak or strong interfacial interactions between the particles and the polymer matrix. Depending on its nature and thickness (or volume fraction), the interphase could significantly participate to the overall mass transfer properties and strongly influence the overall permeability of the composite as evidenced by Liang et al.  in their poly(ethersulfone)/ montmorillonite nanocomposites. These authors hypothesized that the interphase in their nanocomposite structure was made of interface voids due to a poor adhesion between hydrophilic nanoparticles and hydrophobic polymers contributing to the high gas permeability observed.'}], ['4.2.3', 'Modification of the polymer matrix', {1: 'The incorporation of nanoparticles could result in the disruption of polymer chain packing, causing an increase of polymer matrix free volume. This increase in free volume leads to an increase in permeability or to a lesser decrease than expected. This impact on free volume is often just a hypothesis that is not always confirmed experimentally, due to the difficulty to experimentally access such information.', 2: 'Such hypothesis of polymer matrix modification with increase of free volume was speculated by several authors for isodimensional particles-based composites with titanium dioxide (Matteucci et al. , Moghadam et al. ) or silica nanoparticles (Dougnac et al. , Romero et al. ) and in elongated particles-based nanocomposites with carbon nanotube (Murali et al. ). An increase of free volume was also hypothesized to occur when using compatibilizing agents due to bad compatibility between the compatibilizer and the surface treated particles (Mittal et al. ). The addition of nanoparticles in a polymer matrix could also hinder the crystallization process if chain mobility is hindered, leading thus to a decrease of the overall crystallinity of the polymer that could contribute to enhance the overall mass transfer within the composite (Dougnac et al. ).', 3: 'We noted that this increase of free volume is often considered as a global explanation resulting from different phenomena: in addition to the modification of polymer matrix, increase in free volume could also result in void space formation by nanoparticles aggregation and weak interaction between polymer-nanoparticles at interface (Moghadam et al. ). All these mechanisms are not easily distinguished. Therefore, authors stressed an overall increase of free volume that they experimentally assessed by density measurements, without distinguishing all underlying mechanisms. Indeed, if the density of the nanoparticles, crystalline polymer and amorphous polymer phases has their pure component values in the nanocomposites, then the density of a nanocomposite sample, would be equal to the theoretical additive density. The difference between theoretical and experimental densities can be rationalized by the overall increase of free volume as evidenced by (Matteucci et al. ) in spherical-based composites with titanium dioxide.'}], ['4.2.4', 'Increasing migrant sorption', {1: 'The increase of P/P <sub>0</sub> could be related to the establishment of specific interactions between the molecular penetrant and the material constituents, as largely observed for water vapor and hygroscopic nanoparticles such as silica nanoparticles (Bracho et al. , Dougnac et al. ) or microcrystalline cellulose (Dogan et al. ), and also for O <sub>2</sub> and organo-modified montmorillonite (Chang et al. ), for O <sub>2</sub> or modified silica nanoparticles (Iwata et al. ) or CO <sub>2</sub> and titanium dioxide nanoparticles (Matteucci et al. ).', 2: 'Different mechanisms could occur concomitantly, explaining why significant effects on P/P <sub>0</sub> are not systematically observed. For instance, Dogan et al.  did not notice any significant change of the water vapor permeability in hydroxyl propyl methyl cellulose/microcrystalline cellulose nanocomposites in spite of a tortuosity effect. This was ascribed to the occurrence of a competitive effect, i.e. an increased water affinity with the materials. The same happened in the study of Matteucci et al. : they observed an enhancement of CO <sub>2</sub> permeability in spherical-based composites with titanium dioxide due to an increase in gas solubility in the nanocomposite films upon incorporation of highly sorbing nanoparticles into the polymer. This effect is overlapping with the creation of voids and global increase in free volume with increasing particle loading. It should be noted that all these explanations are always hypotheses that are usually not experimentally validated.', 3: 'Fig.  is providing summary of the two previous Sections 4.1 and 4.2 with key take home messages about the main mechanisms explaining monotonic increase of decrease of the ratio P/P 0 .'}], ['4.3', 'Non-monotonic variation of P/P ', {1: 'The permeability towards gases and water vapor did not always monotonically vary. In a general manner, theories already provided above for explaining monotonic decrease or increase of P/P <sub>0</sub> remain valid in that case and apply to a specific part of the curve.', 2: 'The most observed non-monotonic variation of P/P <sub>0</sub> is first a decrease of P/P <sub>0</sub> until reaching a threshold value of filler content, followed by a sudden increase of P/P 0 . This evolution is generally ascribed to a change in the nanostructure as a function of filler content. For example, in the work of Sanchez-Garcia et al.  dealing with montmorillonite-based nanocomposites, the permeability first decreased due to a tortuosity effect and then increased for filler contents higher than 5 vol% due to the formation of agglomerates. In the case of elongated particles-based nanocomposites (Dogan et al. , Saxena et al. , Paralikar et al. ), a similar evolution was observed with the formation of particle agglomerates at higher particle volume fractions (generally &gt; 10 vol%). In addition to agglomeration that could reverse the trend of variation of P/P <sub>0</sub> , some extensive cracking of the composite film could occur and lead to a complete loss of barrier properties (Chaiko et al. ), which was attributed by the authors to excessive particle agglomeration at high particle fraction.', 3: 'An opposite evolution has been also noted in the case of water vapor as migrant: first, an increase of the water vapor permeability probably caused by enhanced affinity between water vapor and composite constituents displaying a hydrophilic nature and, second, a decrease of the permeability induced by the tortuosity that finally is sufficient enough at high loading rates to decrease the permeability value. This has been observed by Follain et al.  for poly(ε-caprolactone)/cellulose nanocrystals.'}], ['4.4', 'Explanation of the evolution of the permeability in line with the evolution of solubility and diffusivity coefficients', {1: 'In this section, it is considered that the properties of the polymer matrix are not affected by the incorporation of nanoparticles and that nanocomposites are two-phases systems with a perfect adhesion at the particle/matrix interface. This makes the relation P = D × S, where P, D and S are respectively the permeability, diffusion and solubility coefficients, valid . In order to explain the complex evolution of P/P <sub>0</sub> as a function of filler content, some authors tried to decompose the permeability into diffusivity and solubility and to relate the apparent evolution of P/P <sub>0</sub> to change in D or S or both. For that purpose, they generally determined the diffusivity and/or solubility coefficients independently of the permeability.', 2: 'In nanocomposites, a decrease in permeability should be ideally related to a decrease in both diffusivity and solubility coefficients due to the formation of a more tortuous pathway (influence on D) and to the diminution of the volume for the sorption of gases or vapors. However, this ideal case was not always observed. In most cases, solubility did not systematically decrease and tended either to remain constant or even to increase.', 3: 'For example, O <sub>2</sub> /CO <sub>2</sub> solubility was found to remain constant in poly(amide-6-b-ethylene oxide)  or brominated poly(2,6-diphenyl-1,4-phenylene oxide)  filled with silica nanoparticles while CO <sub>2</sub> solubility was found to increase with the addition of silica particles in polybenzimidazole . Despite the fact that the same nanoparticle was used in these three studies, the effect on gas solubility obtained was not. This demonstrated that if the particles could be considered as impermeable (D=0), it is not true for their solubility. As mentioned above in § 3.2, increase of S could also be related to the progressive uncovering of active sorption sites in the polymer matrix as a consequence of particle addition and to the creation of specific sites at the particle/polymer interface that favor the sorption of molecular penetrants as hypothesized by Sadeghi et al.  and Suzuki et al. .', 4: 'As regards the diffusivity coefficient, the expected behavior is a decrease due to the restriction of the motion of molecular penetrant and the creation of a more tortuous path caused by the presence of the particles . But the opposite phenomenon could also occur. Sadeghi et al. , seeking to understand the increase of the permeability in polyvinyl acetate with the addition of silica nanoparticles, made the assumption that the diffusivity coefficient could increase either due to a reduction of the packing density of the polymer which provides further open structures for the diffusion of CO <sub>2</sub> or to a reduction of the crystallinity which lead to more amorphous phases where diffusion happens. The latter effect was also hypothesized by Kono et al.  and Ahn et al.  on silica nanoparticle based nanocomposite. The diffusivity could also remain constant or increase with the addition of impermeable particles due to bad adhesion or compatibility between constituents or the creation of interconnected cavities/channels as evidenced by Suzuki et al. , Kim et al.  and Cong et al. .', 5: 'To sum up, following analysis of all aforementioned experimental evidences, we can conclude that there is generally a competition between an increase of the solubility and a decrease of the diffusivity. Therefore, non-monotonic changes of P/P <sub>0</sub> , in peculiar, decrease of P/ P <sub>0</sub> followed by an increase for higher particle volume fraction, could be generally ascribed to an increase of S that could, from a threshold value of particle volume fraction, counteract the decrease of D.'}], ['4.5', 'Discussion of the selective transport characteristics of nanocomposite membranes', {1: 'In the context of developing barrier films, it is also interesting to Fig. .

It is indeed of high interest in many applications to develop nanocomposites that are designed to provide a very strong barrier to one component (for instance oxygen) while remaining permeable to another (such as carbon dioxide or water vapor). In this purpose, CO <sub>2</sub> / O <sub>2</sub> selectivity and H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity were calculated, when possible, from the data gathered in the framework of this study and plotted as a function of the nanoparticle volume fraction (Figs. ). In most of cases, CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> and H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity was not initially in the objective of the original works used to derive it. Therefore, it was not systematically possible to calculate it from the permeability data available per reference. It must be noted that for the sake of clarity, for H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity, the ratio of nanocomposite selectivity to neat polymer selectivity is used in Fig.  while absolute values of PCO <sub>2</sub> /PO <sub>2</sub> are directly plotted in Fig. , because they display less range of variation.', 2: 'As it can be seen in Fig. , and in the logic of result of the Fig.  analysis, there are much more data of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity available for layered particles than for iso-dimensional particles and elongated ones where only four references have permitted to calculate this value. It is thus not possible to draw meaningful conclusions about the evolution of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity for elongated nanoparticles-based nanocomposites (Fig. ).', 3: 'Logically, CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity of layered particles-based nanocomposites was centered around a mean value of 4, which is usually the permselectivity of oil-based polymers used as neat matrix in most of the studies (Fig. ).

Two studies nevertheless lead to an increase of the CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity as a function of nanoparticle volume fraction . In the work of Meera et al. , the decrease of permeability as a function of filler content is much higher for O <sub>2</sub> than for CO <sub>2</sub> leading to an increase of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permeability ratio while it seems to be the contrary for Merinska et al. . In the same time and for another combination of filler/polymer (Nanofill 5 as MMT/PP), the data of Merinska et al.  permitted to obtain a decrease of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity. Alena et al.  also observed either an increase or decrease of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity depending on the type of nanoparticle (MMT) used in LDPE matrix. These last features confirm the random nature of the evolution of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity as a function of nanoparticle volume fraction. We noted that this notion of permselectivity and its evolution as a function of filler content was never explained nor even highlighted by the aforementioned group of authors.', 4: 'For isodimensional particles-based nanocomposites, the CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity is also centered around a value of 5 (Fig. ) and kept almost constant as a function of filler volume fraction. Nevertheless, a group of 5 studies displays very high CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity (&gt; 15). Among this group of studies, we noted a general trend toward an increase of permselectivity with nanoparticle volume fraction (4 studies  observing an increase against only one  observing a decrease). Variation of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity in the aforementioned studies was principally due to the fact that O <sub>2</sub> and CO <sub>2</sub> permeability did not decrease as much as a function of filler content resulting in a nonconstant PCO <sub>2</sub> /PO <sub>2</sub> ratio. Results of Zoppi et al.  and Kim et al.  with high CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity were obtained on PEBAX® (copolymer with polyamide-6 and poly(ethyleneoxide)) which is known to display high CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> selectivity in packaging application. These authors did not try to explain why the CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity varied in their sample: Kim et al.  focused only on CO <sub>2</sub> /He, CO <sub>2</sub> /N <sub>2</sub> and O <sub>2</sub> /N <sub>2</sub> selectivity and did not notice any variation of these selectivities as a function of nanoparticle volume fraction (about 6 for CO <sub>2</sub> /He, 70 for CO <sub>2</sub> /N <sub>2</sub> and 3 for O <sub>2</sub> /N <sub>2</sub> respectively); Zoppi et al.  focusing on O <sub>2</sub> / N <sub>2</sub> , CO <sub>2</sub> /CH <sub>4</sub> , CO <sub>2</sub> /N <sub>2</sub> and CO <sub>2</sub> /H <sub>2</sub> selectivity did not notice so much variation of this value as a function of nanoparticle content except for very high volume ratio (15 vol/vol%). Only Semsarzadeh et al.  calculated the CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity in their study on polyurethane-silica/polyvinyl alcohol mixed matrix membranes. They noticed that by increasing the silica content in membranes, all gas permselectivities including CO <sub>2</sub> , namely CO <sub>2</sub> /N <sub>2</sub> , CO <sub>2</sub> /CH <sub>4</sub> and CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> increased much more than selectivity including other gases such as O <sub>2</sub> / N <sub>2</sub> , up to 136%, 69% and 47%, respectively. They explained that, while O <sub>2</sub> , N <sub>2</sub> and CH <sub>4</sub> displayed decreasing permeability, CO <sub>2</sub> permeability demonstrated an increase upon increasing silica content due to an increase in the number of the active sites (polar OH groups) for gas dissolution in polymer matrix. The same reduced decrease in CO <sub>2</sub> permeability compared to other gases such as O <sub>2</sub> or N <sub>2</sub> was observed by Sadeghi et al.  in polyether-based polyurethane-silica and polyurethane-silica nanocomposite leading to moderate increase of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> selectivity as a function of nanoparticle content (Fig. ).', 5: 'The comparative examination of permeability and selectivity variation of data collected in the database considered in this work is now in order. Indeed, for the case of inclusion of impermeable particles in a permeable polymer matrix, the anticipated mechanism of induced tortuosity in path of gas molecules is expected to reduce the permeability of different gases by the same extent. A further analysis was thus performed to explore possible correlation between relative permeability and permselectivity in the available set of data. The examination is confined to the case of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> selectivity in nanocomposite obtained from the inclusion of isodimensional or platelet shaped nanoparticles, as only for those cases is a sufficient number of data available to insure the significance of the statistical analysis. In Fig.  the relative permeability for CO <sub>2</sub> in the nanocomposites is related to the corresponding square variation of permselectivity δ defined as follows:', 6: 'where α <sub>NC</sub> and α <sub>M</sub> are CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity in nanocomposite and neat matrix, respectively. Despite the scattering, data in Fig.  put in evidence that, both for the case of isodimensional particles and platelets, relative permeability higher than one is typically accompanied by a significant deviation of nanocomposite permselectivity from the value of neat matrix, while an interval exists for relative permeability of nanocomposite moderately lower than 1, for which the deviation in permselectivity from the value of neat matrix is negligible. Significantly, the above interval for relative permeability extends to lower values for the case of nanocomposites including platelets with respect to the case of isodimensional particles. It can be thus concluded that a good number of studies considered in this work shows results which are at least qualitatively consistent with the picture resulting from the tortuosity effect induced by the dispersed phase to the motion of gas molecules. On the other hand, a large number of nanocomposites exhibiting either relative permeability values higher than one or very low seems to be often characterized by significant variation of the permselectivity, indicating the relevance of additional phenomena hiding the effect of a pure increase in tortuosity path for the motion of gas molecules in the system. As it can be seen in Fig. , data available to calculate H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity are much scarcer than for CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> and, for this reason, the correlation between relative permeability and deviation of permselectivity is not discussed here for this kind of data. No values were even found in the collected references for calculated H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity in iso-dimensional nanoparticle based nanocomposites. Only three references were found for elongated ones. O <sub>2</sub> permeability is rarely investigated concomitantly to H <sub>2</sub> O permeability although H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity is a very important value in many applications such as packaging where sometimes a high barrier property to O <sub>2</sub> is required at the same time as low barrier to H <sub>2</sub> 0. From Fig. , it can be concluded that the H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity did not vary so much as a function of nanoparticle volume fraction except for the study of Kasirga et al. , Chang et al.  and Lee et al.  where H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity tended to dramatically increase then decrease for at least Chang et al.  and Lee et al. . Even if none of these authors intentionally measured nor explained the evolution of H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity, this behavior could be generally ascribed to a better tortuosity effect obtained for H <sub>2</sub> O than for O <sub>2</sub> and, for non-monotonic behavior, to nonlinear decrease in permeability with clay loading.', 7: 'To conclude about the selective transport characteristics of nanocomposites membranes, the previous analysis has highlighted that a correlation exists between permeability and the corresponding selectivity value which could be used to emphasize that deviations from expected behavior for selectivity (either positive or negative variation of selectivity) are often associated with deviations from expected behavior for permeability (very high reduction or increase).'}], ['5', 'Conclusion', {1: 'The recently-measured values of gas (O <sub>2</sub> , CO <sub>2</sub> ) and water vapor permeability in agro-, bio-and synthetic-based nanocomposites have been comprehensively reviewed with emphases on the link between their micro-and nano-structure and their barrier performance.', 2: 'This review has revealed that despite numerous and intensive studies on the optimization of nanocomposite processing and structure in the perspective of modulating their barrier properties, the expected decreasing effect on the permeability is often not so high as expected and sometimes completely the opposite. This review confirmed that layered nanoparticles are more efficient than isodimensional and elongated nanoparticles to decrease the relative permeability (P/P <sub>0</sub> ). But, this effect is difficult to anticipate due to numerous interfering mechanisms that provoke modifications of tortuosity, sorption, polymer matrix (crystallinity, free volume, molar mass), creation of an interphase, voids and cracks, and more that lead to unexpected behaviors of the permeability in nanocomposites. Investigation of the selective transport of CO <sub>2</sub> to O <sub>2</sub> and H <sub>2</sub> 0 to O <sub>2</sub> did not reveal a general trend either and it is also difficult to anticipate.', 3: 'It was concluded that tortuosity, the main mechanism proposed to explain permeability decrease in nanocomposites, often fails in explaining the effect of nanoparticles on nanocomposite barrier properties. This is particularly important knowing that most of the mathematical models used to predict permeability in nanocomposites are based on this tortuosity effect.'}]]\n"

The mass transfers are thus at the heart of the feature of the food packaging, especially transfers of water vapor, oxygen and/or carbon dioxide, which condition the rates of numerous reactions of food degradation (oxidation, microbial development, physiological reactions, etc.). The development of bulk nanocomposite structures by introducing nanoparticles, i.e. fillers having at least one dimension lower than 100 nm, in polymeric matrices appeared as one of the most promising directions in the development of packaging materials with advanced mass transfer properties. The expected role of these inclusions is to achieve a significant decrease of the mass transfer properties as compared to the neat matrix by acting as physical obstacles to the diffusion and permeation of diffusing molecules, which have to follow a more tortuous pathway. This phenomenon is called the tortuosity effect.'^^xsd:string ;\n",

      "onner:paragraphText 'Many types of nanoparticles have already been tested to modulate mass transfer properties, with hundreds of permeability data published in literature. Nanoparticles can be classified into three major categories according to their particle shape (Fig. ): (i) isodimensional particles, that have the same size in all directions and an aspect ratio close to unity (such as spherical silica, TiO <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles, carbon black and fullerenes); (ii) elongated particles that consist in fibrils with a diameter ranging between 1 and 100 nm and length up to several hundred nanometers (such as carbon nanotubes or cellulose nanofibers); and (iii) layered particles that are characterized by one dimension ranging from several angstroms to several nanometers (such as layered silicates or starch nanocrystals). Among the three aforementioned types of particles, it is widely recognized that inclusion of impermeable platelets such as clays in the polymer should significantly enhance its barrier properties. However, an in-depth study of the available data in the literature revealed that it was not systematically the case and, even, on the contrary could lead to a deterioration of the barrier properties. Many reviews deal with the functional properties of nanocomposites, by mainly focusing on mechanical properties . Among these studies, some of them focused slightly on the mass transfer properties  but without deepening the topic. These studies generally focused on one type of nanoparticle, i.e. spherical nanoparticles or nano-platelets for instance, particularly for membrane applications. Few of them focused on food packaging applications . The last exhaustive review in the field is that of Cui et al.  that focused on gas barrier properties of clay-based polymer nanocomposites. However, the effect of the platelet-shape has never been compared and discussed along with results obtained with spherical and elongated particle shape. In spite of all these preceding reviews, there is still a huge lack of analysis of all available data in the perspective of deciphering the role of particle shape on the mass transfer properties of the resulting nanocomposite materials, even if it has been highlighted as a key input parameter in mathematical models. As far as we knew, there is no review that proposes an exhaustive analysis of the experimental permeability values from the available literature.'^^xsd:string ;\n",

      "onner:paragraphText 'In order to better correlate the mass transfer properties in nanocomposite materials with their multi-scale structure, the objective of the present review is to decipher and comprehensively discuss the role of the nanoparticle shape (either isodimensional, elongated or layered) on the modulation of the mass transfer properties in nanocomposites, as a function of filler volume fraction and in the light of the nanocomposite structure achieved. For that purpose, more than 1000 values (i.e. about 170 articles) of the 1995-2015 period containing measured values of O <sub>2</sub> , CO <sub>2</sub> and H <sub>2</sub> O permeability in polymer-based nanocomposites were collected from the available literature and capitalized in a dedicated on-line database . All data could be uploaded from the permalink provided in figure caption (https://doi.org/10.5281/ zenodo.1136269). The proposed on-line database consists in the first and unprecedented compilation of permeability values for nanocomposite based materials. The current work is focused on direct analysis and comparison of experiments, without any mediation which could be provided by quantitative models. It must be specified that, in order to build up the database for analysis, which is of interest here, recent data for gas barrier in polymer based materials with dispersed graphene and graphene derivatives were not taken into consideration. In fact, while the latter represent nanocomposite materials with dispersed layered domains, the extremely high aspect ratio and flexibility of graphene layers reduces the threshold value for percolation in these materials to much lower values than in traditional layered particles nanocomposites . Under those conditions, in the volume concentration range for layered particles which is of reference in this work (in the order of 10% by volume) layers arrangement and layer defects are significantly more relevant to the barrier effect than the aspect ratio (particle shape) itself. For a comparison between gas barrier properties in polymer/clay and polymer/graphene nanocomposite see the review by Tan . For the above reason, although graphene has attracted much attention in recent years for the production of polymer based composites for packaging, analysis of pertinent results for gas barrier properties is left to a different discussion and the interested reader is addressed to recent reviews in the field .'^^xsd:string ;\n",

Examples of reference publications for layered silicates-based nanocomposites are those of Alexandre &amp; Dubois , Ray et al. , Pavlidou et al. , Mittal et al.  and Cui et al. , for natural fibre-based nanocomposites, those of Saheb et al.  and Siqueira et al.  and for inorganic spherical particle-based nanocomposites, those of Cong et al.  and Chung et al. . Due to the large range of polymer matrices and nanoparticles, different processing routes have been proposed to produce nanocomposites based on their convenience according to the nature of the raw constituents and their field of application (Fig. ). At laboratory scale, four main processes are most commonly used to prepare polymer-based nanocomposites from all the types of nanoparticles. Melt processing and solution blending are two processes based on the use of polymers, which lead to the formation of Van der Waals interactions between the constituents, while insitu polymerization and sol/gel methods are based on the use of monomers or oligomers, leading to the formation of covalent bonds between the polymer and the nanoparticles (Fig. ). At industrial scale, melt processing is generally preferred due to the difficulty to implement processes requiring the use of huge volumes of solvent.'^^xsd:string ;\n",

This review confirmed that layered nanoparticles are more efficient than isodimensional and elongated nanoparticles to decrease the relative permeability (P/P <sub>0</sub> ). But, this effect is difficult to anticipate due to numerous interfering mechanisms that provoke modifications of tortuosity, sorption, polymer matrix (crystallinity, free volume, molar mass), creation of an interphase, voids and cracks, and more that lead to unexpected behaviors of the permeability in nanocomposites. Investigation of the selective transport of CO <sub>2</sub> to O <sub>2</sub> and H <sub>2</sub> 0 to O <sub>2</sub> did not reveal a general trend either and it is also difficult to anticipate.'^^xsd:string ;\n",
