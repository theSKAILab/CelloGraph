materials:
-cellulosic pulp
	- plant pulp
	- wood pulp
		- virgin wood pulp (def.: produced from wood?)
	- recovered paper
	- disolving wood pulp
- regenerated cellulose (equivalent to:? manmade cellulosic film and fiber)

- sources of cellulose-based materials
	- plants?? 
	- (raw) wood
	- waste paper or paperboard??

- cellulosic derivates ??

- cellulosis products
	- wood products
		- paper or paperboard??
		- wood-based panels
		- sawnwood
		- wood-based fuels
		- 

- cellulose-based materials 
	- cellulosic fibers
	- plant fibers 
	- wood?? (products? and resources)
	- paper or paperboard?? (products and resources?) 

-textile fibers:
	- natural textile fibers: def: intersection of natural fibers (cellulosis fibers as specialization) and textile fibers (based on the use of the fiber?)
		- cotton (not included in plant fibers?)
		- plant fibers
		- wood (should this be cellulosic fibers?; why not a specialization of plant fiber??)
		- down
		- silk
