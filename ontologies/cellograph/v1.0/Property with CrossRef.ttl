## Template for adding more qualities (properties)
## All properties that are of materials (rather than chemical entities such as chemical elements) need to be a subclass of  CG_2000002
## the properties should be numbered starting with CG_2000004, with the more general classes (e.g. "mechanical property of a material") receiving lower numbers and more specific classes receiving higher numbers
