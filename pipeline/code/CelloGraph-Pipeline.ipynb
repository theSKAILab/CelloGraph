Details of its crystalline phases are given, starting with a description of molecular and supramolecular structures, including the hydrogen bond systems. Sources of this ubiquitous biopolymer are mentioned, with attention to the special properties of bacterially synthesized nanofibrous cellulose. Nanostructures obtained by disintegration of cellulose fibers (top-down approach) yielding nano-or microfibrillated cellulose and cellulose whiskers are the basis for novel materials with extraordinary properties. Moreover, nanofibers and nanoparticles can be made by special techniques applying the bottom-up approach. Efficient systems to dissolve cellulose by destruction of the hydrogen bond systems using ionic liquids and systems based on polar aprotic solvent and salt are described. Novel cellulose derivatives are available by chemical modification under heterogeneous or homogeneous conditions, depending on the cellulose reactivity. In particular, unconventional nucleophilic displacement reactions yielding products for high-value applications are highlighted. Novel amino cellulose derivatives showing fully reversible aggregation behavior and nanostructure formation on various materials are the focus of interest. Finally, \"click chemistry\" for the synthesis of novel cellulose derivatives is discussed.'}],\n",

In addition to the long-standing scientific interest in cellulose, the use of cellulose as renewable and biodegradable raw material in various applications is a proposed solution to the recent industrial challenge to successfully meet environmental and recycling problems . Versatile structuring of cellulose by various routes of modification, including both physical and chemical methods, has enabled its use in a variety of applications (e.g., fillers, building and coating materials, laminates, papers, textiles, optical films, sorption media, viscosity regulators, and even advanced functional materials) .',\n",
       "   2: 'The earliest systematic efforts that lead to the discovery of cellulose began in 1837 with the work of the French chemist Anselme Payen, who showed that various plant materials yielded a fibrous substance after purification with acid-ammonia treatment and extraction with water, alcohol, and ether. The French Academy finally named the resulting carbohydrate \"cellulose\" . Nowadays, there are various processes used to isolate cellulose, for example, the alkaline, bisulfite, and sulfate (kraft-) processes, in combination with thermal and mechanical treatments. The different processes result in varying fiber strengths of the pulp .',\n",

Cellulose contributes approximately 40% to the carbon fraction in plants, serving as structuring element within the complex architecture of their cell walls. Cellulose can occur in pure form in plants but it is usually accompanied by hemicelluloses, lignins, and comparably small amounts of extractives. Wood contains about 40-50 wt% cellulose. Comparable amounts can be found in bagasse , bamboo , straw (40-50 wt%), and even higher in flax (70-80 wt%), hemp , jute , kapok , and ramie (70-75 wt %). Cotton is a fairly pure cellulose source, containing more than 90 wt% . An impressive amount of cellulose is produced each year, not only in wood fiber from trees (ca. 1,750,000 kt world production) but also in annual plants such as bamboo (10,000 kt), cotton linters , jute (2,300 kt), flax (830 kt), sisal (378 kt), hemp (214 kt), and ramie (100 kt) . In addition, several fungi and green algae produce cellulose (e.g., Valonia ventricosa, Chaetamorpha melagonicum, Glaucocystis) and some (marine) animals such as ascidians contain cellulose in their outer membrane. Moreover, bacteria of the genera Gluconacetobacter, Agrobacterium, Pseudomonas, Rhizobium, and Sarcina can synthesize bacterial cellulose from glucose and various other carbon sources . Bacterial cellulose, which is produced directly as a fibrous network, contains no lignin, pectin, hemicelluloses, or other biogenic products; it is very highly crystalline and possesses a high degree of polymerization (DP).'}],\n",

Cellobiose with a length of 1.3 nm can be considered the repeating unit of cellulose . Three reactive hydroxyl groups exist in each anhydroglucose unit (AGU) within the cellulose chain, a primary group at C6 and two secondary groups at C2 and C3 that are positioned in the plane of the ring (Fig. ).',\n",

Together with the β-glycosidic covalent linkage, the intramolecular hydrogen bonds are responsible for the rigidity or stiffness of the cellulose polymer . As a result, highly viscous solutions are produced from cellulose relative to those obtained from equivalent polysaccharides bonded by α-glycosidic linkages. This also leads to a high tendency to crystallize or to form fibrillar structures.',\n",

In comparison to cellulose I, the cellulose II molecules are more densely packed and strongly interbonded and, therefore, cellulose II is less reactive, as commonly observed .

Moreover, the treatment of cellulose with aqueous alkali (mainly aqueous sodium hydroxide) is the key step for activating the polymer prior to heterogeneous chemical modification, particularly for commercial etherification. The structure of cellulose II was revised by neutron fiber diffraction analysis . Two chains of cellulose are located antiparallel on the 2 1 axis of the monoclinic cell (Fig. ), while the chains are displaced relative to each other by about one fourth of the AGU.

The cellulose chains arrange as a basic fibrillar unit, the so-called elementary fibrils, which have been reported to be 100 nm in length and have a characteristic lateral dimension of 1.5-3.5 nm . Such elementary fibrils are further assembled as fibrillar bundles, called microfibrils, with widths in the range of 10-30 nm.

MC is commercially produced by treatment of biomass with aqueous sodium hydroxide to remove other constituents , followed by acidic hydrolysis. During hydrolysis, the DP of cellulose decreases with hydrolysis time until reaching a plateau value called \"level off DP\" (LODP), which ranges between 25 and 300 depending on the cellulose source . The hydrolysis takes place in the less crystalline regions, leaving a solid residue that is water-insoluble and crystalline. As a result of the motion freedom of the hydrolyzed crystallites, structures are produced that have larger dimensions than the original microfibrils  forming a stable aqueous dispersion upon vigorous stirring. However, colloidal destabilization of the small crystalline domains can occur upon removal of acid by dialysis followed by spraydrying . In such dry form, MC morphology varies from stubby to fibrillar. Importantly, sulfate half-ester moieties are introduced on the microcrystals (sulfur content 0.5-2%) when sulfuric acid is used for hydrolysis . The negative charge developed in aqueous media by these groups is the main contributor to colloidal stability of the dispersion, and its viscosity has been found to strongly depend on the charge density . HCl is the hydrolytic medium of choice if MC is to be produced for applications that require the absence of electrostatic charges (e.g., in order to enhance enzyme interactions, binding, and attack). Such HCl-hydrolyzed MC is uncharged and can be of similar shape and size to that from sulfuric acid hydrolysis (Fig. ). Concentrated dispersions of MC obtained with HCl show thixotropy (concentration &gt;5%) whereas antithixotropic behavior is displayed at lower concentrations (&lt;0.3%).

An enzymatically produced precursor yields whiskers in a more efficient two-step process . Enzymatic hydrolysis is milder than the more aggressive acid hydrolysis and yields whiskers that are relatively longer and more entangled, resulting in a hydrogel network that possesses much greater strength. Cellulose nanocrystals take rodlike shapes with a typical width of a few nanometers and length of the order of hundreds of nanometers . Such dimensions depend on the cellulose source and amorphous cellulose content, and are thus influenced by the conditions used during hydrolysis. Cellulose nanocrystals display a small number of defects and show no signs of chain folding. A large elastic modulus (~150 GPa) and strength (~7 GPa) have been typically calculated or determined for cellulose nanocrystals, which also possess a very low thermal expansion coefficient (~10 <super>À7</super> K <super>À1</super> ) .

At low concentrations, cellulose nanocrystals are randomly oriented in water and appear as oval or spherical features . As the concentration is increased, the nanocrystals selfassemble along a vector to yield a typical cholesteric liquid crystalline phase. The chiral nematic order can be retained upon removal of water and results in iridescent films, the color of which can be easily tuned by changing the salt concentration, pH, and temperature of the suspension . At higher ionic strength (e.g., by addition of HCl, NaCl, or KCl), the electrical double-layer effect is screened out and the chiral interactions become stronger. The counter-ion also effects the interactions between particles. In the presence of protons, the cellulose suspensions form ordered phases at the lowest critical concentration. Application of a magnetic field during drying of cellulose films results in perfect orientation of the whiskers, leading to colored materials that can be used as security paper. The color change depends on the viewing angle, which is useful for production of optically variable coatings and inks. Figure  shows different domains of the cellulose nanocrystals, suggesting an ordered phase (Fig. ) and a well-defined cholesteric phase (Fig. ) . Under an external magnetic field, small angle neutron scattering (SANS) experiments indicate that the cholesteric axis of the chiral nematic phase aligns with the magnetic field . Along the cholesteric axis, the distance between the cellulose particles is shorter than perpendicular to it. This evidence suggests a helical twist of the cellulose whiskers.',\n",

Limitations to the application of solvents result from high toxicity, high reactivity of the solvents leading to undesired side reactions, and loss of solubility during reactions. The latter results in inhomogeneous mixtures through formation of gels and pastes, which are difficult to mix, and even through formation of de-swollen particles of low reactivity, which settle out in the reaction medium. Homogeneous reaction conditions give the opportunity for esterification with state of the art reagents, for example, after in situ activation of carboxylic acids, which is characterized by reacting the carboxylic acid with a reagent to form an intermediate, highly reactive carboxylic acid derivative. The carboxylic acid derivative can be formed prior to reaction with the polysaccharide or converted directly in a one-pot reaction. Modification of cellulose with carboxylic acids after in situ activation has made a broad variety of new esters accessible, because common reactive derivatives such as anhydrides or chlorides are not accessible for numerous acids (e.g., unsaturated or hydrolytically instable acids). The mild reaction conditions applied for in situ activation avoids side reactions such as pericyclic reactions, hydrolysis, and oxidation . For example, a reaction with enormous potential for cellulose modification is the homogeneous one-pot reaction after in situ activation of carboxylic acids with N,N <super>0</super> -carbonyldiimidazole (CDI), which has been well known in bioorganic chemistry since 1962 . The reactive imidazolide of the acid is generated, and the by-products CO <sub>2</sub> and imidazole are nontoxic (Fig. ). The pH is almost constant during the conversion, resulting in negligible chain degradation. In comparison to dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), the application of CDI is much more efficient, avoids most of the side reactions, and allows the use of DMSO (a good solvent for most complex carboxylic acids).'}],\n",

Cellulose dissolved in BMIMCl/co-solvent mixtures can be easily converted into cellulose sulfate (CS) by using SO <sub>3</sub> -Py, SO <sub>3</sub> -DMF, or ClSO <sub>3</sub> H . Highly substituted CS with DS values up to 3 has been reported for sulfation in BMIMCl at 30 C ; however, it should be noted that cellulose/IL solutions slowly turned solid upon cooling to room temperature, depending on the cellulose and moisture content. Synthesis of CS with an even distribution of sulfate groups along the polymer chains requires a dipolar aprotic co-solvent that drastically reduces the solution viscosity and does not significantly influence the reactivity of the sulfating agent . At a 2:1 molar ratio of SO <sub>3</sub> -DMF/AGU, the sulfation of microcrystalline cellulose in BMIMCl and BMIMCl/DMF mixtures leads to comparable DS values of about 0.86. Whereas CS synthesized without co-solvent is insoluble, the other readily dissolves in water.',\n",

Physical and chemical modification reactions yielding fibers, film, sponges, and cellulose ethers and esters are of high commercial importance today. However, research and development in the field of nanostructuring of cellulose and cellulose derivatives, homogeneous chemistry with cellulose applying various solvents (including molten salts, ionic liquids, and water-based systems) can open new avenues for product design with modern organic chemistry. It can be expected that homogeneous phase chemistry will enter the technical scale in the future. Not only chemical modification of the bulk, but also surface modification (i.e., products with low DS) can provide important novel materials. Last but not least, as discussed in this review paper, depending on its nano-and microstructured architectures, versatile characteristics of the biopolymer cellulose can be achieved and addressed to a specific function. Consequently, cellulose is a promising and broadly applicable material not only (as commonly known) in the paper and textile industries but also for medical and pharmaceutical devices, among others. The applications of nano-and microstructured cellulose can further be broadened by chemical and physical surface treatments.\",\n",
