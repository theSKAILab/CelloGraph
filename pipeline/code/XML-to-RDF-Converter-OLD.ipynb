Cellulose nanofibers were obtained from traditional mechanical methods, and cellulose nanocrystals were obtained via sulfuric acid hydrolysis. After cellulose extraction and size reduction, different composites were elaborated using poly(lactic acid) as matrix varying fiber concentrations and using cellulosic particles of diverse size and surface modification (3aminopropyl triethoxysilane silanized cellulose nanofibers and dodecanoyl chloride esterified cellulose nanocrystals). Non-cellulosic elimination and the effect of surface modifications were analyzed with infrared analysis, showing characteristic intensities for cellulosic species and new peaks for each modification (characteristic ester peak ∼1740 cm −1 , and amino peak ∼1550 cm −1 ) cellulose nanofibers and nanocrystals were observed with atom-force microscopy; crystallinity of nano-scale cellulose before and after modifications was obtained with X-ray diffraction to analyze the performance of the modifications. Composites were tested with stress-strain standard methods showing better mechanical properties when surface modifications were performed and the amount of filler was 0.5 wt% reaching an increase in strain to fracture of more than 20%.</ns0:p>'}]]\n"

In the case of cellulose nanofibers (a), the action of the high pressure homogenization allowed to tear microfibrillated cellulose into single nanofibers or groups of 2-3 nanofibers attached; in this case, shape is less constant as fibers are presented sometimes separated in one of their ends but still attached in the other, this because mechanical isolation methods do not eliminate amorphous cellulose that can still be left after the bleaching processes, anyhow the average length was 607 ± 85 nm and the average width 68 ± 22 nm.

These patterns were obtained using symmetrical transmission mode. It can be seen that peaks associated with cellulose corresponding to 1 0 1, 1 0 −1, 0 0 2 and 0 4 0 crystalline planes are present in all the cases with different intensity and broadening caused by the amount of crystalline cellulose of each sample and the presence of different components. Broadened peaks are associated to the presence of non-crystalline particles in the powder sample, this can be observed in the BAST sample, in which peaks at 2Â = 14.9, 17.41 and 22.36 • present low intensity and broadened peaks, this can be related to either hemicelluloses or amorphous cellulose as it has been suggested in previous reports <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b29\">(Park et al., 2010)</ns0:ref> that this fiber components give broadened peaks. On the other hand, BANC sample has sharper signals and the peaks at 2Â = 14. <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\">52, 16.59, 22.57 and 34.88</ns0:ref> • and also has a clearer and smoother signal than the others presented.</ns0:p>', 5: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">In Table <ns0:ref type=\"table\" target=\"#tab_1\">2</ns0:ref>, the estimated crystallinity and apparent crystallite size are presented (left) peak deconvolution method with Voigt fitting curve can be useful for qualitative comparison of the behavior of cellulose during a series of treatments. It can be observed a considerable increase in crystallinity after the pulping and bleaching methods (between BAST and BABP) that happens when amorphous lignin and hemicelluloses are discarded from the original fibers, after mechanical homogenization there is no significant increase  in crystallinity as the chemical structure of the fiber is not attacked during this process, this can also be seen in the apparent crystallite size, as even after mechanical treatments the size of the crystallite is in the same range. BANC obtained after hydrolysis present the highest relative crystallinity (an increase of ∼10% respect to bleached cellulose) as the hydrolysis effectively eliminates amorphous cellulose from the fibers, leaving crystalline cellulose and in consequence, the range of crystallite size is decreased.</ns0:p>', 6: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">In case of modified cellulose, the surface modification performed in each sample generated a new amorphous region around the crystalline cellulose by hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups present in the exterior chains of the molecular wall. XRD results concur with previous AT-IR analysis respecting the formation of a new surface in cellulose. In the case of BANS, it can be appreciated a slight increase in the crystallite size as a result of the addition of amino chains to the crystalline region; in Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_5\">6</ns0:ref>,  the peak deconvolution for the BANS (lower right) signal shows three new low-signal broad peaks at 2Â = 24.97, 30.25 and 37.67 • with an average H of 4.1 ± 0.56 • . For the BADC sample, the addition of large aliphatic chains generates a whole new region around the crystal particles; this can be concluded as the estimated crystallite size is 53% bigger than the original BANC sample. This new aliphatic chains in the crystalline surface diminish the crystallinity of the modified cellulose as the morphology is altered <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\">(C ¸etin et al., 2009)</ns0:ref>. In Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_4\">5</ns0:ref> (upper right) the deconvoluted peaks for the BADC sample shows a new low-intensity peak at 2Â = 7.99 • that is in the range of the associated diffraction of aliphatic chains for a number of carbons higher than 7 <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b27\">(Missoum et al., 2012)</ns0:ref>. There are also new peaks at 2Â = 25.26 and 28.44 • that broaden the base of the peaks corresponding to cellulose at the 0 0 2 plane. Surface modification increases the hydrophobicity of cellulose fibers; contact angle provides further information respecting the interaction between the surface of the CNC and CNF and the hydrophobic agent. Table <ns0:ref type=\"table\" target=\"#tab_2\">3</ns0:ref> presents the contact angles (Â <sub>w</sub> ) of cellulose after bleaching as well as modified CNC and CNF. When comparing Â <sub>w</sub> for BAST and BABP, it can be seen a decay on contact angle, this proves the typical hydrophilic character of cellulose. The increase in Â <sub>w</sub> is related to the topology of the surface, either because of the size of the particle avoid the surface roughness or because of the reaction of hydroxyl groups with non-polar particles, even though during surface modification not all hydroxyl groups may react, the possibility of water molecules to penetrate the substrate when dealing at nano-scale is reduced. It can be seen in the BADC sample that the hydrophobic character is increased (Â <sub>w</sub> ∼81.06 • ), while for unmodified bleached cellulose was ∼31.74 • . In case of the ATS modified cellulose, it can be observed a n increase in the surface hydrophobicity of ∼31.45 • more than unmodified cellulose, but still is less than in the case of BADC, this is related to the features associated with the components of the respective modification, as well as with the specific surface of the particle; nano-scale cellulose has more hydroxyl groups to react with, this groups have strong hydrogen bonding with the surface modification agent that generates a shield against water sorption <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b11\">(Fadeev and McCarthy, 1999;</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b6\">Dankovich and Gray, 2011)</ns0:ref>.</ns0:p>'}], ['3.3', 'Characterization of the composites', {1: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_6\">7</ns0:ref> shows the visual aspect of the different composites compared to a pellet made of powdered fibers from the different fillers.

Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_7\">8</ns0:ref> shows SEM images of different composites with 2 wt% content of filler, stronger interactions can be seen between the matrix and esterified CNC, whilst in composites with silanized CNF the interaction is lower.

The addition of anisotropic material to the polymeric matrix influences the performance in uniaxial stress <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b1\">(Auras et al., 2003;</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b21\">Jamshidian et al., 2010)</ns0:ref>. It can be observed a considerable decrease of the mechanical properties when adding cellulose without any surface modification in composites reinforced with bleached pulp, cellulose nanofibers and cellulose nanocrystals, in which ultimate tensile strength (UTS) presents a decrease from the 45.29 MPa that has the PLA without any filler; this is accentuated as the percent of filler is increased, reaching a drop of approximately 25% when the filler reaches 2% of the composite. In general, the behavior of composites under uniaxial   stress is similar to the obtained in previous publications, with an increase in the UTS and a decrease in the strain at fracture when cellulosic fillers are added <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b23\">(Kowalczyk et al., 2011)</ns0:ref>. Qualitative analysis shows differences with previously reported works with another type of cellulose modifications in which tensile stress and modulus are higher but the strain at break is considerably lower <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b3\">(Bondeson and Oksman, 2007)</ns0:ref> this kind of variations and the ones presented in this wok reflect the importance that the surface modification of cellulose has in the elaboration of composites. In case of BANF and BANC, both have similar UTS values and are higher than those of bleached pulp. On the other hand, PLA composites reinforced with modified nano-particles have better UTS than any other and are slightly better in the case of BADC. With regard to the strain at fracture, ductility of PLA is decreased when mixed with more crystalline material, this particularity can be observed with more clearness in the PLA-BANC composite in which the average maximum elongation is dropped by an average of 48% from the unfilled PLA, as the stronger bonds between the highly crystalline cellulose inhibit the elongation of the fiber. The addition of noncrystalline components to the surface of CNF and CNC enhances the interaction between the filler and the matrix, allowing a better displacement in the axial direction under tension, with strain being increased by ∼18% in the case of 0.5% BADC and ∼25% in the case of 0.5% BANS composites; this value gradually descends as the amount of filler represents a higher percent in the composite, as either 1% and 2% concentrations of BANS and BADC have lower values for maximum strain than PLA without fillers. The behavior of all composites shows a mechanical decay when the amount of filler is increased, this situation can be related with the morphology and the composition of the filler as amorphous parts of BABP, BANF and BAST; lignin content in BAST and coupling agents in BADC and BANC benefit the interactions between crystalline cellulose and PLA; but when the share of the filler inside the composite is increased, the anisotropy characteristic to organic fillers in polymeric matrices, gets a major role in the response of the composite to uniaxial stress, generating more dislocations inside the composite. Furthermore, higher amount of filler material can generate agglomerations that result in a deterioration of tensile stress transfer between matrix and filler, generating a more brittle structure <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b44\">(Zhang et al., 2008)</ns0:ref>.</ns0:p>', 3: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">In Table <ns0:ref type=\"table\" target=\"#tab_4\">5</ns0:ref> glass transition temperature (T <sub>g</sub> ), melt temperature (T <sub>m</sub> ), crystallization temperature (T <sub>c</sub> ), enthalpy of melting (H <sub>m</sub> ), and enthalpy of crystallization (H <sub>c</sub> ) of the different composites are presented.

To study the relevance of composition and surface modification in natural fibers, different chemical and mechanical treatments were performed. The analysis of composites made with the same material throughout the complete process can help to determine the relevance and feasibility of the treatments and then decide if whether or not is worthy. Hydrophilic character of cellulose surface was modified with 3aminopropyl triethoxysilane in case of nanofibers and dodecanoyl chloride in case of nanocrystals. The behavior toward contact angle and tensile tests showed the potential of these modifications as suitable methods to enhance mechanical properties and hydrophobicity because of the formation of non-polar covalent bonding between free hydroxyl and coupling agents, also enhancing dispersion inside the matrix, this has an important potential in creating barrier materials to avoid contact with water. Exists an inversely proportional relation between the amount of filler and the uniaxial mechanical properties, this can be related to agglomerations and the anisotropy of the filler inside the matrix, also the addition of nano-scale particles enhanced the interaction between matrixfiller. Thermal properties showed a better crystallization of the PLA chains when reinforcements were added without affecting the final crystallinity of the polymer.</ns0:p>'}]]\n"

It can be observed a considerable increase in crystallinity after the pulping and bleaching methods (between BAST and BABP) that happens when amorphous lignin and hemicelluloses are discarded from the original fibers, after mechanical homogenization there is no significant increase  in crystallinity as the chemical structure of the fiber is not attacked during this process, this can also be seen in the apparent crystallite size, as even after mechanical treatments the size of the crystallite is in the same range. BANC obtained after hydrolysis present the highest relative crystallinity (an increase of ∼10% respect to bleached cellulose) as the hydrolysis effectively eliminates amorphous cellulose from the fibers, leaving crystalline cellulose and in consequence, the range of crystallite size is decreased.</ns0:p>', 6: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">In case of modified cellulose, the surface modification performed in each sample generated a new amorphous region around the crystalline cellulose by hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups present in the exterior chains of the molecular wall. XRD results concur with previous AT-IR analysis respecting the formation of a new surface in cellulose. In the case of BANS, it can be appreciated a slight increase in the crystallite size as a result of the addition of amino chains to the crystalline region; in Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_5\">6</ns0:ref>,  the peak deconvolution for the BANS (lower right) signal shows three new low-signal broad peaks at 2Â = 24.97, 30.25 and 37.67 • with an average H of 4.1 ± 0.56 • . For the BADC sample, the addition of large aliphatic chains generates a whole new region around the crystal particles; this can be concluded as the estimated crystallite size is 53% bigger than the original BANC sample. This new aliphatic chains in the crystalline surface diminish the crystallinity of the modified cellulose as the morphology is altered <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\">(C ¸etin et al., 2009)</ns0:ref>. In Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_4\">5</ns0:ref> (upper right) the deconvoluted peaks for the BADC sample shows a new low-intensity peak at 2Â = 7.99 • that is in the range of the associated diffraction of aliphatic chains for a number of carbons higher than 7 <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b27\">(Missoum et al., 2012)</ns0:ref>. There are also new peaks at 2Â = 25.26 and 28.44 • that broaden the base of the peaks corresponding to cellulose at the 0 0 2 plane. Surface modification increases the hydrophobicity of cellulose fibers; contact angle provides further information respecting the interaction between the surface of the CNC and CNF and the hydrophobic agent. Table <ns0:ref type=\"table\" target=\"#tab_2\">3</ns0:ref> presents the contact angles (Â <sub>w</sub> ) of cellulose after bleaching as well as modified CNC and CNF. When comparing Â <sub>w</sub> for BAST and BABP, it can be seen a decay on contact angle, this proves the typical hydrophilic character of cellulose. The increase in Â <sub>w</sub> is related to the topology of the surface, either because of the size of the particle avoid the surface roughness or because of the reaction of hydroxyl groups with non-polar particles, even though during surface modification not all hydroxyl groups may react, the possibility of water molecules to penetrate the substrate when dealing at nano-scale is reduced. It can be seen in the BADC sample that the hydrophobic character is increased (Â <sub>w</sub> ∼81.06 • ), while for unmodified bleached cellulose was ∼31.74 • . In case of the ATS modified cellulose, it can be observed a n increase in the surface hydrophobicity of ∼31.45 • more than unmodified cellulose, but still is less than in the case of BADC, this is related to the features associated with the components of the respective modification, as well as with the specific surface of the particle; nano-scale cellulose has more hydroxyl groups to react with, this groups have strong hydrogen bonding with the surface modification agent that generates a shield against water sorption <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b11\">(Fadeev and McCarthy, 1999;</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b6\">Dankovich and Gray, 2011)</ns0:ref>.</ns0:p>'}], ['3.3', 'Characterization of the composites', {1: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">Fig. <ns0:ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_6\">7</ns0:ref> shows the visual aspect of the different composites compared to a pellet made of powdered fibers from the different fillers.

It can be observed a considerable decrease of the mechanical properties when adding cellulose without any surface modification in composites reinforced with bleached pulp, cellulose nanofibers and cellulose nanocrystals, in which ultimate tensile strength (UTS) presents a decrease from the 45.29 MPa that has the PLA without any filler; this is accentuated as the percent of filler is increased, reaching a drop of approximately 25% when the filler reaches 2% of the composite. In general, the behavior of composites under uniaxial   stress is similar to the obtained in previous publications, with an increase in the UTS and a decrease in the strain at fracture when cellulosic fillers are added <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b23\">(Kowalczyk et al., 2011)</ns0:ref>. Qualitative analysis shows differences with previously reported works with another type of cellulose modifications in which tensile stress and modulus are higher but the strain at break is considerably lower <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b3\">(Bondeson and Oksman, 2007)</ns0:ref> this kind of variations and the ones presented in this wok reflect the importance that the surface modification of cellulose has in the elaboration of composites. In case of BANF and BANC, both have similar UTS values and are higher than those of bleached pulp. On the other hand, PLA composites reinforced with modified nano-particles have better UTS than any other and are slightly better in the case of BADC. With regard to the strain at fracture, ductility of PLA is decreased when mixed with more crystalline material, this particularity can be observed with more clearness in the PLA-BANC composite in which the average maximum elongation is dropped by an average of 48% from the unfilled PLA, as the stronger bonds between the highly crystalline cellulose inhibit the elongation of the fiber. The addition of noncrystalline components to the surface of CNF and CNC enhances the interaction between the filler and the matrix, allowing a better displacement in the axial direction under tension, with strain being increased by ∼18% in the case of 0.5% BADC and ∼25% in the case of 0.5% BANS composites; this value gradually descends as the amount of filler represents a higher percent in the composite, as either 1% and 2% concentrations of BANS and BADC have lower values for maximum strain than PLA without fillers. The behavior of all composites shows a mechanical decay when the amount of filler is increased, this situation can be related with the morphology and the composition of the filler as amorphous parts of BABP, BANF and BAST; lignin content in BAST and coupling agents in BADC and BANC benefit the interactions between crystalline cellulose and PLA; but when the share of the filler inside the composite is increased, the anisotropy characteristic to organic fillers in polymeric matrices, gets a major role in the response of the composite to uniaxial stress, generating more dislocations inside the composite. Furthermore, higher amount of filler material can generate agglomerations that result in a deterioration of tensile stress transfer between matrix and filler, generating a more brittle structure <ns0:ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b44\">(Zhang et al., 2008)</ns0:ref>.</ns0:p>', 3: '<ns0:p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">In Table <ns0:ref type=\"table\" target=\"#tab_4\">5</ns0:ref> glass transition temperature (T <sub>g</sub> ), melt temperature (T <sub>m</sub> ), crystallization temperature (T <sub>c</sub> ), enthalpy of melting (H <sub>m</sub> ), and enthalpy of crystallization (H <sub>c</sub> ) of the different composites are presented.

To study the relevance of composition and surface modification in natural fibers, different chemical and mechanical treatments were performed. The analysis of composites made with the same material throughout the complete process can help to determine the relevance and feasibility of the treatments and then decide if whether or not is worthy. Hydrophilic character of cellulose surface was modified with 3aminopropyl triethoxysilane in case of nanofibers and dodecanoyl chloride in case of nanocrystals. The behavior toward contact angle and tensile tests showed the potential of these modifications as suitable methods to enhance mechanical properties and hydrophobicity because of the formation of non-polar covalent bonding between free hydroxyl and coupling agents, also enhancing dispersion inside the matrix, this has an important potential in creating barrier materials to avoid contact with water. Exists an inversely proportional relation between the amount of filler and the uniaxial mechanical properties, this can be related to agglomerations and the anisotropy of the filler inside the matrix, also the addition of nano-scale particles enhanced the interaction between matrixfiller. Thermal properties showed a better crystallization of the PLA chains when reinforcements were added without affecting the final crystallinity of the polymer.</ns0:p>'}]]\n"

In both silanized (b) cellulose nanofibers and esterified (c) cellulose nanocrystals, it can be observed the changes in the behavior of these bands because of the modification of the free hydroxyl present in the natural cellulose, that have reacted with the amino group in the case of ATS and the aliphatic acid chains in the case of DDC. Peaks at ∼2854 (c-1) and ∼2923 cm <super>−1</super> (c-2) correspond to the C H band, belonging to aliphatic acid chains, also a new peak can be observed at ∼1743 cm <super>−1</super> (c-3) corresponding to the 1750-1735 cm <super>−1</super> ester carbonyl band , this three peaks that occur in characteristic bands of DDC prove the successful esterification of the CNC. In the silanized CNF spectrum it can be observed a new peak at ∼1550 cm <super>−1</super> (b-4) that corresponds to the amino scissoring bending vibration, also in the 1300-1000 cm <super>−1</super> band (b-5 to b-6) there is an increase in the cellulose peaks because of the chemisorbed ATS related to the Si O Si bonding , therefore it can be assumed that a proper surface modification was performed on both CNC and CNF.', 2: 'Blue agave pulp is composed of strong fibers with high content of cellulose and hemicelluloses.

The action of sulfuric acid in the cellulose fibers allowed the isolation of cellulose nanocrystals (b) with an average width of 33 ± 13 nm and length 350 ± 153 nm with a very homogenized shape. In the case of cellulose nanofibers (a), the action of the high pressure homogenization allowed to tear microfibrillated cellulose into single nanofibers or groups of 2-3 nanofibers attached; in this case, shape is less constant as fibers are presented sometimes separated in one of their ends but still attached in the other, this because mechanical isolation methods do not eliminate amorphous cellulose that can still be left after the bleaching processes, anyhow the average length was 607 ± 85 nm and the average width 68 ± 22 nm. In both cases aspect ratio left a large amount of surface able to modify images (c) and (d) show silanized nanofibers and esterified nanocrystals, respectively, it can be clearly observed the surface modification and the formation of particle aggregates.', 4: 'The diffraction patterns corresponding to BAST, BABP and both BANF and BANC, are presented in Fig. . These patterns were obtained using symmetrical transmission mode. It can be seen that peaks associated with cellulose corresponding to 1 0 1, 1 0 −1, 0 0 2 and 0 4 0 crystalline planes are present in all the cases with different intensity and broadening caused by the amount of crystalline cellulose of each sample and the presence of different components. Broadened peaks are associated to the presence of non-crystalline particles in the powder sample, this can be observed in the BAST sample, in which peaks at 2Â = 14.9, 17.41 and 22.36 • present low intensity and broadened peaks, this can be related to either hemicelluloses or amorphous cellulose as it has been suggested in previous reports  that this fiber components give broadened peaks. On the other hand, BANC sample has sharper signals and the peaks at 2Â = 14.  • and also has a clearer and smoother signal than the others presented.', 5: 'In Table , the estimated crystallinity and apparent crystallite size are presented (left) peak deconvolution method with Voigt fitting curve can be useful for qualitative comparison of the behavior of cellulose during a series of treatments. It can be observed a considerable increase in crystallinity after the pulping and bleaching methods (between BAST and BABP) that happens when amorphous lignin and hemicelluloses are discarded from the original fibers, after mechanical homogenization there is no significant increase  in crystallinity as the chemical structure of the fiber is not attacked during this process, this can also be seen in the apparent crystallite size, as even after mechanical treatments the size of the crystallite is in the same range. BANC obtained after hydrolysis present the highest relative crystallinity (an increase of ∼10% respect to bleached cellulose) as the hydrolysis effectively eliminates amorphous cellulose from the fibers, leaving crystalline cellulose and in consequence, the range of crystallite size is decreased.', 6: 'In case of modified cellulose, the surface modification performed in each sample generated a new amorphous region around the crystalline cellulose by hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups present in the exterior chains of the molecular wall. XRD results concur with previous AT-IR analysis respecting the formation of a new surface in cellulose. In the case of BANS, it can be appreciated a slight increase in the crystallite size as a result of the addition of amino chains to the crystalline region; in Fig. ,  the peak deconvolution for the BANS (lower right) signal shows three new low-signal broad peaks at 2Â = 24.97, 30.25 and 37.67 • with an average H of 4.1 ± 0.56 • . For the BADC sample, the addition of large aliphatic chains generates a whole new region around the crystal particles; this can be concluded as the estimated crystallite size is 53% bigger than the original BANC sample. This new aliphatic chains in the crystalline surface diminish the crystallinity of the modified cellulose as the morphology is altered . In Fig.  (upper right) the deconvoluted peaks for the BADC sample shows a new low-intensity peak at 2Â = 7.99 • that is in the range of the associated diffraction of aliphatic chains for a number of carbons higher than 7 . There are also new peaks at 2Â = 25.26 and 28.44 • that broaden the base of the peaks corresponding to cellulose at the 0 0 2 plane. Surface modification increases the hydrophobicity of cellulose fibers; contact angle provides further information respecting the interaction between the surface of the CNC and CNF and the hydrophobic agent. Table  presents the contact angles (Â <sub>w</sub> ) of cellulose after bleaching as well as modified CNC and CNF. When comparing Â <sub>w</sub> for BAST and BABP, it can be seen a decay on contact angle, this proves the typical hydrophilic character of cellulose. The increase in Â <sub>w</sub> is related to the topology of the surface, either because of the size of the particle avoid the surface roughness or because of the reaction of hydroxyl groups with non-polar particles, even though during surface modification not all hydroxyl groups may react, the possibility of water molecules to penetrate the substrate when dealing at nano-scale is reduced. It can be seen in the BADC sample that the hydrophobic character is increased (Â <sub>w</sub> ∼81.06 • ), while for unmodified bleached cellulose was ∼31.74 • . In case of the ATS modified cellulose, it can be observed a n increase in the surface hydrophobicity of ∼31.45 • more than unmodified cellulose, but still is less than in the case of BADC, this is related to the features associated with the components of the respective modification, as well as with the specific surface of the particle; nano-scale cellulose has more hydroxyl groups to react with, this groups have strong hydrogen bonding with the surface modification agent that generates a shield against water sorption .'}], ['3.3', 'Characterization of the composites', {1: 'Fig.  shows the visual aspect of the different composites compared to a pellet made of powdered fibers from the different fillers. The color contribution is related to the addition of either silanes (yellow) or dodecanoyl chloride (brown). Fig.  shows SEM images of different composites with 2 wt% content of filler, stronger interactions can be seen between the matrix and esterified CNC, whilst in composites with silanized CNF the interaction is lower. In both unmodified cellulose particles, dislocations were observed in the surface contact between matrix and filler, thus confirming the strengthened bonds that ATS and DDC provide to cellulose nanoparticles.', 2: 'Table  presents the data corresponding to ultimate tensile strength and strain at break results for the different elaborated composites and Fig.  shows characteristic Tensile-Stress graphs for each composite. The addition of anisotropic material to the polymeric matrix influences the performance in uniaxial stress . It can be observed a considerable decrease of the mechanical properties when adding cellulose without any surface modification in composites reinforced with bleached pulp, cellulose nanofibers and cellulose nanocrystals, in which ultimate tensile strength (UTS) presents a decrease from the 45.29 MPa that has the PLA without any filler; this is accentuated as the percent of filler is increased, reaching a drop of approximately 25% when the filler reaches 2% of the composite. In general, the behavior of composites under uniaxial   stress is similar to the obtained in previous publications, with an increase in the UTS and a decrease in the strain at fracture when cellulosic fillers are added . Qualitative analysis shows differences with previously reported works with another type of cellulose modifications in which tensile stress and modulus are higher but the strain at break is considerably lower  this kind of variations and the ones presented in this wok reflect the importance that the surface modification of cellulose has in the elaboration of composites. In case of BANF and BANC, both have similar UTS values and are higher than those of bleached pulp. On the other hand, PLA composites reinforced with modified nano-particles have better UTS than any other and are slightly better in the case of BADC. With regard to the strain at fracture, ductility of PLA is decreased when mixed with more crystalline material, this particularity can be observed with more clearness in the PLA-BANC composite in which the average maximum elongation is dropped by an average of 48% from the unfilled PLA, as the stronger bonds between the highly crystalline cellulose inhibit the elongation of the fiber. The addition of noncrystalline components to the surface of CNF and CNC enhances the interaction between the filler and the matrix, allowing a better displacement in the axial direction under tension, with strain being increased by ∼18% in the case of 0.5% BADC and ∼25% in the case of 0.5% BANS composites; this value gradually descends as the amount of filler represents a higher percent in the composite, as either 1% and 2% concentrations of BANS and BADC have lower values for maximum strain than PLA without fillers. The behavior of all composites shows a mechanical decay when the amount of filler is increased, this situation can be related with the morphology and the composition of the filler as amorphous parts of BABP, BANF and BAST; lignin content in BAST and coupling agents in BADC and BANC benefit the interactions between crystalline cellulose and PLA; but when the share of the filler inside the composite is increased, the anisotropy characteristic to organic fillers in polymeric matrices, gets a major role in the response of the composite to uniaxial stress, generating more dislocations inside the composite. Furthermore, higher amount of filler material can generate agglomerations that result in a deterioration of tensile stress transfer between matrix and filler, generating a more brittle structure .', 3: 'In Table  glass transition temperature (T <sub>g</sub> ), melt temperature (T <sub>m</sub> ), crystallization temperature (T <sub>c</sub> ), enthalpy of melting (H <sub>m</sub> ), and enthalpy of crystallization (H <sub>c</sub> ) of the different composites are presented. Bulk PLA presents a T <sub>g</sub> of 63.22 • C and Tm 175.66 • C this results are similar to those reported in previous works . Changes in T <sub>g</sub> are not significant between different composites, in more crystalline reinforcements such as silanized nanofibers or cellulose nanocrystals it can be observed a slight variation in the T <sub>c</sub> (between 3 and 5 • C) this changes and the increase of the enthalpy of fusion show a good nucleation of the cellulose crystallites enhancing the chain flow of PLA around the crystals whilst the crystallinity and the melting temperature is not highly affected.'}], ['4', 'Conclusions', {1: 'Six different composites were elaborated using PLA as a matrix and blue agave bagasse as raw material. To study the relevance of composition and surface modification in natural fibers, different chemical and mechanical treatments were performed. The analysis of composites made with the same material throughout the complete process can help to determine the relevance and feasibility of the treatments and then decide if whether or not is worthy. Hydrophilic character of cellulose surface was modified with 3aminopropyl triethoxysilane in case of nanofibers and dodecanoyl chloride in case of nanocrystals. The behavior toward contact angle and tensile tests showed the potential of these modifications as suitable methods to enhance mechanical properties and hydrophobicity because of the formation of non-polar covalent bonding between free hydroxyl and coupling agents, also enhancing dispersion inside the matrix, this has an important potential in creating barrier materials to avoid contact with water. Exists an inversely proportional relation between the amount of filler and the uniaxial mechanical properties, this can be related to agglomerations and the anisotropy of the filler inside the matrix, also the addition of nano-scale particles enhanced the interaction between matrixfiller. Thermal properties showed a better crystallization of the PLA chains when reinforcements were added without affecting the final crystallinity of the polymer.'}]]\n"

Signals between 3600 and 3000 cm <super>−1</super> correspond to OH vibration in cellulose; the band between 3000 and 2600 cm <super>−1</super> corresponds to asymmetric and symmetric C H stretching vibration present in cellulose (1-2), moreover, the peaks present at ∼1430, ∼1162 and ∼1111 cm <super>−1</super> (a-5 to a-6) are assigned to CH <sub>2</sub> symmetric bending, asymmetric C O C bridge stretching, anhydroglucose ring asymmetric stretching, respectively, this is associated with the crystalline part of the cellulose, the peak at ∼893 cm <super>−1</super> is assigned to C H deformation of cellulose associated to the non-crystalline cellulose . In both silanized (b) cellulose nanofibers and esterified (c) cellulose nanocrystals, it can be observed the changes in the behavior of these bands because of the modification of the free hydroxyl present in the natural cellulose, that have reacted with the amino group in the case of ATS and the aliphatic acid chains in the case of DDC. Peaks at ∼2854 (c-1) and ∼2923 cm <super>−1</super> (c-2) correspond to the C H band, belonging to aliphatic acid chains, also a new peak can be observed at ∼1743 cm <super>−1</super> (c-3) corresponding to the 1750-1735 cm <super>−1</super> ester carbonyl band , this three peaks that occur in characteristic bands of DDC prove the successful esterification of the CNC. In the silanized CNF spectrum it can be observed a new peak at ∼1550 cm <super>−1</super> (b-4) that corresponds to the amino scissoring bending vibration, also in the 1300-1000 cm <super>−1</super> band (b-5 to b-6) there is an increase in the cellulose peaks because of the chemisorbed ATS related to the Si O Si bonding , therefore it can be assumed that a proper surface modification was performed on both CNC and CNF.', 2: 'Blue agave pulp is composed of strong fibers with high content of cellulose and hemicelluloses. Fig.  shows SEM images of bagasse fibers as received from the supplier, defibrillation present in (a) can be due to the characteristic sugar extraction process to which blue agave bagasse is subjected during traditional industrial process as has been suggested by previous work  Experiments with plants from the same family like sisal,  have proven the necessity of an aggressive hydrolysis of the bleached pulp to break the amorphous regions of the cell wall.', 3: 'Fig.  presents the atomic force microscopy of cellulose fibers after mechanical or chemical treatment. The action of sulfuric acid in the cellulose fibers allowed the isolation of cellulose nanocrystals (b) with an average width of 33 ± 13 nm and length 350 ± 153 nm with a very homogenized shape. In the case of cellulose nanofibers (a), the action of the high pressure homogenization allowed to tear microfibrillated cellulose into single nanofibers or groups of 2-3 nanofibers attached; in this case, shape is less constant as fibers are presented sometimes separated in one of their ends but still attached in the other, this because mechanical isolation methods do not eliminate amorphous cellulose that can still be left after the bleaching processes, anyhow the average length was 607 ± 85 nm and the average width 68 ± 22 nm. In both cases aspect ratio left a large amount of surface able to modify images (c) and (d) show silanized nanofibers and esterified nanocrystals, respectively, it can be clearly observed the surface modification and the formation of particle aggregates.', 4: 'The diffraction patterns corresponding to BAST, BABP and both BANF and BANC, are presented in Fig. . These patterns were obtained using symmetrical transmission mode. It can be seen that peaks associated with cellulose corresponding to 1 0 1, 1 0 −1, 0 0 2 and 0 4 0 crystalline planes are present in all the cases with different intensity and broadening caused by the amount of crystalline cellulose of each sample and the presence of different components. Broadened peaks are associated to the presence of non-crystalline particles in the powder sample, this can be observed in the BAST sample, in which peaks at 2Â = 14.9, 17.41 and 22.36 • present low intensity and broadened peaks, this can be related to either hemicelluloses or amorphous cellulose as it has been suggested in previous reports  that this fiber components give broadened peaks. On the other hand, BANC sample has sharper signals and the peaks at 2Â = 14.  • and also has a clearer and smoother signal than the others presented.', 5: 'In Table , the estimated crystallinity and apparent crystallite size are presented (left) peak deconvolution method with Voigt fitting curve can be useful for qualitative comparison of the behavior of cellulose during a series of treatments. It can be observed a considerable increase in crystallinity after the pulping and bleaching methods (between BAST and BABP) that happens when amorphous lignin and hemicelluloses are discarded from the original fibers, after mechanical homogenization there is no significant increase  in crystallinity as the chemical structure of the fiber is not attacked during this process, this can also be seen in the apparent crystallite size, as even after mechanical treatments the size of the crystallite is in the same range. BANC obtained after hydrolysis present the highest relative crystallinity (an increase of ∼10% respect to bleached cellulose) as the hydrolysis effectively eliminates amorphous cellulose from the fibers, leaving crystalline cellulose and in consequence, the range of crystallite size is decreased.', 6: 'In case of modified cellulose, the surface modification performed in each sample generated a new amorphous region around the crystalline cellulose by hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups present in the exterior chains of the molecular wall. XRD results concur with previous AT-IR analysis respecting the formation of a new surface in cellulose. In the case of BANS, it can be appreciated a slight increase in the crystallite size as a result of the addition of amino chains to the crystalline region; in Fig. ,  the peak deconvolution for the BANS (lower right) signal shows three new low-signal broad peaks at 2Â = 24.97, 30.25 and 37.67 • with an average H of 4.1 ± 0.56 • . For the BADC sample, the addition of large aliphatic chains generates a whole new region around the crystal particles; this can be concluded as the estimated crystallite size is 53% bigger than the original BANC sample. This new aliphatic chains in the crystalline surface diminish the crystallinity of the modified cellulose as the morphology is altered . In Fig.  (upper right) the deconvoluted peaks for the BADC sample shows a new low-intensity peak at 2Â = 7.99 • that is in the range of the associated diffraction of aliphatic chains for a number of carbons higher than 7 . There are also new peaks at 2Â = 25.26 and 28.44 • that broaden the base of the peaks corresponding to cellulose at the 0 0 2 plane. Surface modification increases the hydrophobicity of cellulose fibers; contact angle provides further information respecting the interaction between the surface of the CNC and CNF and the hydrophobic agent. Table  presents the contact angles (Â <sub>w</sub> ) of cellulose after bleaching as well as modified CNC and CNF. When comparing Â <sub>w</sub> for BAST and BABP, it can be seen a decay on contact angle, this proves the typical hydrophilic character of cellulose. The increase in Â <sub>w</sub> is related to the topology of the surface, either because of the size of the particle avoid the surface roughness or because of the reaction of hydroxyl groups with non-polar particles, even though during surface modification not all hydroxyl groups may react, the possibility of water molecules to penetrate the substrate when dealing at nano-scale is reduced. It can be seen in the BADC sample that the hydrophobic character is increased (Â <sub>w</sub> ∼81.06 • ), while for unmodified bleached cellulose was ∼31.74 • . In case of the ATS modified cellulose, it can be observed a n increase in the surface hydrophobicity of ∼31.45 • more than unmodified cellulose, but still is less than in the case of BADC, this is related to the features associated with the components of the respective modification, as well as with the specific surface of the particle; nano-scale cellulose has more hydroxyl groups to react with, this groups have strong hydrogen bonding with the surface modification agent that generates a shield against water sorption .'}], ['3.3', 'Characterization of the composites', {1: 'Fig.  shows the visual aspect of the different composites compared to a pellet made of powdered fibers from the different fillers. The color contribution is related to the addition of either silanes (yellow) or dodecanoyl chloride (brown). Fig.  shows SEM images of different composites with 2 wt% content of filler, stronger interactions can be seen between the matrix and esterified CNC, whilst in composites with silanized CNF the interaction is lower. In both unmodified cellulose particles, dislocations were observed in the surface contact between matrix and filler, thus confirming the strengthened bonds that ATS and DDC provide to cellulose nanoparticles.', 2: 'Table  presents the data corresponding to ultimate tensile strength and strain at break results for the different elaborated composites and Fig.  shows characteristic Tensile-Stress graphs for each composite. The addition of anisotropic material to the polymeric matrix influences the performance in uniaxial stress . It can be observed a considerable decrease of the mechanical properties when adding cellulose without any surface modification in composites reinforced with bleached pulp, cellulose nanofibers and cellulose nanocrystals, in which ultimate tensile strength (UTS) presents a decrease from the 45.29 MPa that has the PLA without any filler; this is accentuated as the percent of filler is increased, reaching a drop of approximately 25% when the filler reaches 2% of the composite. In general, the behavior of composites under uniaxial   stress is similar to the obtained in previous publications, with an increase in the UTS and a decrease in the strain at fracture when cellulosic fillers are added . Qualitative analysis shows differences with previously reported works with another type of cellulose modifications in which tensile stress and modulus are higher but the strain at break is considerably lower  this kind of variations and the ones presented in this wok reflect the importance that the surface modification of cellulose has in the elaboration of composites. In case of BANF and BANC, both have similar UTS values and are higher than those of bleached pulp. On the other hand, PLA composites reinforced with modified nano-particles have better UTS than any other and are slightly better in the case of BADC. With regard to the strain at fracture, ductility of PLA is decreased when mixed with more crystalline material, this particularity can be observed with more clearness in the PLA-BANC composite in which the average maximum elongation is dropped by an average of 48% from the unfilled PLA, as the stronger bonds between the highly crystalline cellulose inhibit the elongation of the fiber. The addition of noncrystalline components to the surface of CNF and CNC enhances the interaction between the filler and the matrix, allowing a better displacement in the axial direction under tension, with strain being increased by ∼18% in the case of 0.5% BADC and ∼25% in the case of 0.5% BANS composites; this value gradually descends as the amount of filler represents a higher percent in the composite, as either 1% and 2% concentrations of BANS and BADC have lower values for maximum strain than PLA without fillers. The behavior of all composites shows a mechanical decay when the amount of filler is increased, this situation can be related with the morphology and the composition of the filler as amorphous parts of BABP, BANF and BAST; lignin content in BAST and coupling agents in BADC and BANC benefit the interactions between crystalline cellulose and PLA; but when the share of the filler inside the composite is increased, the anisotropy characteristic to organic fillers in polymeric matrices, gets a major role in the response of the composite to uniaxial stress, generating more dislocations inside the composite. Furthermore, higher amount of filler material can generate agglomerations that result in a deterioration of tensile stress transfer between matrix and filler, generating a more brittle structure .', 3: 'In Table  glass transition temperature (T <sub>g</sub> ), melt temperature (T <sub>m</sub> ), crystallization temperature (T <sub>c</sub> ), enthalpy of melting (H <sub>m</sub> ), and enthalpy of crystallization (H <sub>c</sub> ) of the different composites are presented. Bulk PLA presents a T <sub>g</sub> of 63.22 • C and Tm 175.66 • C this results are similar to those reported in previous works . Changes in T <sub>g</sub> are not significant between different composites, in more crystalline reinforcements such as silanized nanofibers or cellulose nanocrystals it can be observed a slight variation in the T <sub>c</sub> (between 3 and 5 • C) this changes and the increase of the enthalpy of fusion show a good nucleation of the cellulose crystallites enhancing the chain flow of PLA around the crystals whilst the crystallinity and the melting temperature is not highly affected.'}], ['4', 'Conclusions', {1: 'Six different composites were elaborated using PLA as a matrix and blue agave bagasse as raw material. To study the relevance of composition and surface modification in natural fibers, different chemical and mechanical treatments were performed. The analysis of composites made with the same material throughout the complete process can help to determine the relevance and feasibility of the treatments and then decide if whether or not is worthy. Hydrophilic character of cellulose surface was modified with 3aminopropyl triethoxysilane in case of nanofibers and dodecanoyl chloride in case of nanocrystals. The behavior toward contact angle and tensile tests showed the potential of these modifications as suitable methods to enhance mechanical properties and hydrophobicity because of the formation of non-polar covalent bonding between free hydroxyl and coupling agents, also enhancing dispersion inside the matrix, this has an important potential in creating barrier materials to avoid contact with water. Exists an inversely proportional relation between the amount of filler and the uniaxial mechanical properties, this can be related to agglomerations and the anisotropy of the filler inside the matrix, also the addition of nano-scale particles enhanced the interaction between matrixfiller. Thermal properties showed a better crystallization of the PLA chains when reinforcements were added without affecting the final crystallinity of the polymer.'}]]\n"

XRD results concur with previous AT-IR analysis respecting the formation of a new surface in cellulose. In the case of BANS, it can be appreciated a slight increase in the crystallite size as a result of the addition of amino chains to the crystalline region; in Fig. ,  the peak deconvolution for the BANS (lower right) signal shows three new low-signal broad peaks at 2Â = 24.97, 30.25 and 37.67 • with an average H of 4.1 ± 0.56 • . For the BADC sample, the addition of large aliphatic chains generates a whole new region around the crystal particles; this can be concluded as the estimated crystallite size is 53% bigger than the original BANC sample. This new aliphatic chains in the crystalline surface diminish the crystallinity of the modified cellulose as the morphology is altered . In Fig.  (upper right) the deconvoluted peaks for the BADC sample shows a new low-intensity peak at 2Â = 7.99 • that is in the range of the associated diffraction of aliphatic chains for a number of carbons higher than 7 . There are also new peaks at 2Â = 25.26 and 28.44 • that broaden the base of the peaks corresponding to cellulose at the 0 0 2 plane. Surface modification increases the hydrophobicity of cellulose fibers; contact angle provides further information respecting the interaction between the surface of the CNC and CNF and the hydrophobic agent. Table  presents the contact angles (Â <sub>w</sub> ) of cellulose after bleaching as well as modified CNC and CNF. When comparing Â <sub>w</sub> for BAST and BABP, it can be seen a decay on contact angle, this proves the typical hydrophilic character of cellulose. The increase in Â <sub>w</sub> is related to the topology of the surface, either because of the size of the particle avoid the surface roughness or because of the reaction of hydroxyl groups with non-polar particles, even though during surface modification not all hydroxyl groups may react, the possibility of water molecules to penetrate the substrate when dealing at nano-scale is reduced. It can be seen in the BADC sample that the hydrophobic character is increased (Â <sub>w</sub> ∼81.06 • ), while for unmodified bleached cellulose was ∼31.74 • . In case of the ATS modified cellulose, it can be observed a n increase in the surface hydrophobicity of ∼31.45 • more than unmodified cellulose, but still is less than in the case of BADC, this is related to the features associated with the components of the respective modification, as well as with the specific surface of the particle; nano-scale cellulose has more hydroxyl groups to react with, this groups have strong hydrogen bonding with the surface modification agent that generates a shield against water sorption .'^^xsd:string .\n",

      "onner:paragraphText 'Table  presents the data corresponding to ultimate tensile strength and strain at break results for the different elaborated composites and Fig.  shows characteristic Tensile-Stress graphs for each composite. The addition of anisotropic material to the polymeric matrix influences the performance in uniaxial stress . It can be observed a considerable decrease of the mechanical properties when adding cellulose without any surface modification in composites reinforced with bleached pulp, cellulose nanofibers and cellulose nanocrystals, in which ultimate tensile strength (UTS) presents a decrease from the 45.29 MPa that has the PLA without any filler; this is accentuated as the percent of filler is increased, reaching a drop of approximately 25% when the filler reaches 2% of the composite. In general, the behavior of composites under uniaxial   stress is similar to the obtained in previous publications, with an increase in the UTS and a decrease in the strain at fracture when cellulosic fillers are added . Qualitative analysis shows differences with previously reported works with another type of cellulose modifications in which tensile stress and modulus are higher but the strain at break is considerably lower  this kind of variations and the ones presented in this wok reflect the importance that the surface modification of cellulose has in the elaboration of composites. In case of BANF and BANC, both have similar UTS values and are higher than those of bleached pulp. On the other hand, PLA composites reinforced with modified nano-particles have better UTS than any other and are slightly better in the case of BADC. With regard to the strain at fracture, ductility of PLA is decreased when mixed with more crystalline material, this particularity can be observed with more clearness in the PLA-BANC composite in which the average maximum elongation is dropped by an average of 48% from the unfilled PLA, as the stronger bonds between the highly crystalline cellulose inhibit the elongation of the fiber. The addition of noncrystalline components to the surface of CNF and CNC enhances the interaction between the filler and the matrix, allowing a better displacement in the axial direction under tension, with strain being increased by ∼18% in the case of 0.5% BADC and ∼25% in the case of 0.5% BANS composites; this value gradually descends as the amount of filler represents a higher percent in the composite, as either 1% and 2% concentrations of BANS and BADC have lower values for maximum strain than PLA without fillers. The behavior of all composites shows a mechanical decay when the amount of filler is increased, this situation can be related with the morphology and the composition of the filler as amorphous parts of BABP, BANF and BAST; lignin content in BAST and coupling agents in BADC and BANC benefit the interactions between crystalline cellulose and PLA; but when the share of the filler inside the composite is increased, the anisotropy characteristic to organic fillers in polymeric matrices, gets a major role in the response of the composite to uniaxial stress, generating more dislocations inside the composite. Furthermore, higher amount of filler material can generate agglomerations that result in a deterioration of tensile stress transfer between matrix and filler, generating a more brittle structure .'^^xsd:string .\n",

Bulk PLA presents a T <sub>g</sub> of 63.22 • C and Tm 175.66 • C this results are similar to those reported in previous works . Changes in T <sub>g</sub> are not significant between different composites, in more crystalline reinforcements such as silanized nanofibers or cellulose nanocrystals it can be observed a slight variation in the T <sub>c</sub> (between 3 and 5 • C) this changes and the increase of the enthalpy of fusion show a good nucleation of the cellulose crystallites enhancing the chain flow of PLA around the crystals whilst the crystallinity and the melting temperature is not highly affected.'^^xsd:string .\n",

      "onner:paragraphText 'Six different composites were elaborated using PLA as a matrix and blue agave bagasse as raw material. To study the relevance of composition and surface modification in natural fibers, different chemical and mechanical treatments were performed. The analysis of composites made with the same material throughout the complete process can help to determine the relevance and feasibility of the treatments and then decide if whether or not is worthy. Hydrophilic character of cellulose surface was modified with 3aminopropyl triethoxysilane in case of nanofibers and dodecanoyl chloride in case of nanocrystals. The behavior toward contact angle and tensile tests showed the potential of these modifications as suitable methods to enhance mechanical properties and hydrophobicity because of the formation of non-polar covalent bonding between free hydroxyl and coupling agents, also enhancing dispersion inside the matrix, this has an important potential in creating barrier materials to avoid contact with water. Exists an inversely proportional relation between the amount of filler and the uniaxial mechanical properties, this can be related to agglomerations and the anisotropy of the filler inside the matrix, also the addition of nano-scale particles enhanced the interaction between matrixfiller. Thermal properties showed a better crystallization of the PLA chains when reinforcements were added without affecting the final crystallinity of the polymer.'^^xsd:string .\n",

Non-cellulosic elimination and the effect of surface modifications were analyzed with infrared analysis, showing characteristic intensities for cellulosic species and new peaks for each modification (characteristic ester peak ∼1740 cm −1 , and amino peak ∼1550 cm −1 ) cellulose nanofibers and nanocrystals were observed with atom-force microscopy; crystallinity of nano-scale cellulose before and after modifications was obtained with X-ray diffraction to analyze the performance of the modifications.

XRD results concur with previous AT-IR analysis respecting the formation of a new surface in cellulose. In the case of BANS, it can be appreciated a slight increase in the crystallite size as a result of the addition of amino chains to the crystalline region; in Fig. ,  the peak deconvolution for the BANS (lower right) signal shows three new low-signal broad peaks at 2Â = 24.97, 30.25 and 37.67 • with an average H of 4.1 ± 0.56 • . For the BADC sample, the addition of large aliphatic chains generates a whole new region around the crystal particles; this can be concluded as the estimated crystallite size is 53% bigger than the original BANC sample. This new aliphatic chains in the crystalline surface diminish the crystallinity of the modified cellulose as the morphology is altered . In Fig.  (upper right) the deconvoluted peaks for the BADC sample shows a new low-intensity peak at 2Â = 7.99 • that is in the range of the associated diffraction of aliphatic chains for a number of carbons higher than 7 . There are also new peaks at 2Â = 25.26 and 28.44 • that broaden the base of the peaks corresponding to cellulose at the 0 0 2 plane. Surface modification increases the hydrophobicity of cellulose fibers; contact angle provides further information respecting the interaction between the surface of the CNC and CNF and the hydrophobic agent. Table  presents the contact angles (Â <sub>w</sub> ) of cellulose after bleaching as well as modified CNC and CNF. When comparing Â <sub>w</sub> for BAST and BABP, it can be seen a decay on contact angle, this proves the typical hydrophilic character of cellulose. The increase in Â <sub>w</sub> is related to the topology of the surface, either because of the size of the particle avoid the surface roughness or because of the reaction of hydroxyl groups with non-polar particles, even though during surface modification not all hydroxyl groups may react, the possibility of water molecules to penetrate the substrate when dealing at nano-scale is reduced. It can be seen in the BADC sample that the hydrophobic character is increased (Â <sub>w</sub> ∼81.06 • ), while for unmodified bleached cellulose was ∼31.74 • . In case of the ATS modified cellulose, it can be observed a n increase in the surface hydrophobicity of ∼31.45 • more than unmodified cellulose, but still is less than in the case of BADC, this is related to the features associated with the components of the respective modification, as well as with the specific surface of the particle; nano-scale cellulose has more hydroxyl groups to react with, this groups have strong hydrogen bonding with the surface modification agent that generates a shield against water sorption .'}},\n",

The addition of anisotropic material to the polymeric matrix influences the performance in uniaxial stress . It can be observed a considerable decrease of the mechanical properties when adding cellulose without any surface modification in composites reinforced with bleached pulp, cellulose nanofibers and cellulose nanocrystals, in which ultimate tensile strength (UTS) presents a decrease from the 45.29 MPa that has the PLA without any filler; this is accentuated as the percent of filler is increased, reaching a drop of approximately 25% when the filler reaches 2% of the composite. In general, the behavior of composites under uniaxial   stress is similar to the obtained in previous publications, with an increase in the UTS and a decrease in the strain at fracture when cellulosic fillers are added . Qualitative analysis shows differences with previously reported works with another type of cellulose modifications in which tensile stress and modulus are higher but the strain at break is considerably lower  this kind of variations and the ones presented in this wok reflect the importance that the surface modification of cellulose has in the elaboration of composites. In case of BANF and BANC, both have similar UTS values and are higher than those of bleached pulp. On the other hand, PLA composites reinforced with modified nano-particles have better UTS than any other and are slightly better in the case of BADC. With regard to the strain at fracture, ductility of PLA is decreased when mixed with more crystalline material, this particularity can be observed with more clearness in the PLA-BANC composite in which the average maximum elongation is dropped by an average of 48% from the unfilled PLA, as the stronger bonds between the highly crystalline cellulose inhibit the elongation of the fiber. The addition of noncrystalline components to the surface of CNF and CNC enhances the interaction between the filler and the matrix, allowing a better displacement in the axial direction under tension, with strain being increased by ∼18% in the case of 0.5% BADC and ∼25% in the case of 0.5% BANS composites; this value gradually descends as the amount of filler represents a higher percent in the composite, as either 1% and 2% concentrations of BANS and BADC have lower values for maximum strain than PLA without fillers. The behavior of all composites shows a mechanical decay when the amount of filler is increased, this situation can be related with the morphology and the composition of the filler as amorphous parts of BABP, BANF and BAST; lignin content in BAST and coupling agents in BADC and BANC benefit the interactions between crystalline cellulose and PLA; but when the share of the filler inside the composite is increased, the anisotropy characteristic to organic fillers in polymeric matrices, gets a major role in the response of the composite to uniaxial stress, generating more dislocations inside the composite. Furthermore, higher amount of filler material can generate agglomerations that result in a deterioration of tensile stress transfer between matrix and filler, generating a more brittle structure .'}},\n",

Hydrophilic character of cellulose surface was modified with 3aminopropyl triethoxysilane in case of nanofibers and dodecanoyl chloride in case of nanocrystals. The behavior toward contact angle and tensile tests showed the potential of these modifications as suitable methods to enhance mechanical properties and hydrophobicity because of the formation of non-polar covalent bonding between free hydroxyl and coupling agents, also enhancing dispersion inside the matrix, this has an important potential in creating barrier materials to avoid contact with water. Exists an inversely proportional relation between the amount of filler and the uniaxial mechanical properties, this can be related to agglomerations and the anisotropy of the filler inside the matrix, also the addition of nano-scale particles enhanced the interaction between matrixfiller.

Signals between 3600 and 3000 cm <super>−1</super> correspond to OH vibration in cellulose; the band between 3000 and 2600 cm <super>−1</super> corresponds to asymmetric and symmetric C H stretching vibration present in cellulose (1-2), moreover, the peaks present at ∼1430, ∼1162 and ∼1111 cm <super>−1</super> (a-5 to a-6) are assigned to CH <sub>2</sub> symmetric bending, asymmetric C O C bridge stretching, anhydroglucose ring asymmetric stretching, respectively, this is associated with the crystalline part of the cellulose, the peak at ∼893 cm <super>−1</super> is assigned to C H deformation of cellulose associated to the non-crystalline cellulose . In both silanized (b) cellulose nanofibers and esterified (c) cellulose nanocrystals, it can be observed the changes in the behavior of these bands because of the modification of the free hydroxyl present in the natural cellulose, that have reacted with the amino group in the case of ATS and the aliphatic acid chains in the case of DDC. Peaks at ∼2854 (c-1) and ∼2923 cm <super>−1</super> (c-2) correspond to the C H band, belonging to aliphatic acid chains, also a new peak can be observed at ∼1743 cm <super>−1</super> (c-3) corresponding to the 1750-1735 cm <super>−1</super> ester carbonyl band , this three peaks that occur in characteristic bands of DDC prove the successful esterification of the CNC. In the silanized CNF spectrum it can be observed a new peak at ∼1550 cm <super>−1</super> (b-4) that corresponds to the amino scissoring bending vibration, also in the 1300-1000 cm <super>−1</super> band (b-5 to b-6) there is an increase in the cellulose peaks because of the chemisorbed ATS related to the Si O Si bonding , therefore it can be assumed that a proper surface modification was performed on both CNC and CNF.\n",

The action of sulfuric acid in the cellulose fibers allowed the isolation of cellulose nanocrystals (b) with an average width of 33 ± 13 nm and length 350 ± 153 nm with a very homogenized shape. In the case of cellulose nanofibers (a), the action of the high pressure homogenization allowed to tear microfibrillated cellulose into single nanofibers or groups of 2-3 nanofibers attached; in this case, shape is less constant as fibers are presented sometimes separated in one of their ends but still attached in the other, this because mechanical isolation methods do not eliminate amorphous cellulose that can still be left after the bleaching processes, anyhow the average length was 607 ± 85 nm and the average width 68 ± 22 nm.

Broadened peaks are associated to the presence of non-crystalline particles in the powder sample, this can be observed in the BAST sample, in which peaks at 2Â = 14.9, 17.41 and 22.36 • present low intensity and broadened peaks, this can be related to either hemicelluloses or amorphous cellulose as it has been suggested in previous reports  that this fiber components give broadened peaks.

BANC obtained after hydrolysis present the highest relative crystallinity (an increase of ∼10% respect to bleached cellulose) as the hydrolysis effectively eliminates amorphous cellulose from the fibers, leaving crystalline cellulose and in consequence, the range of crystallite size is decreased.\n",

      "In case of modified cellulose, the surface modification performed in each sample generated a new amorphous region around the crystalline cellulose by hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups present in the exterior chains of the molecular wall. XRD results concur with previous AT-IR analysis respecting the formation of a new surface in cellulose. In the case of BANS, it can be appreciated a slight increase in the crystallite size as a result of the addition of amino chains to the crystalline region; in Fig. ,  the peak deconvolution for the BANS (lower right) signal shows three new low-signal broad peaks at 2Â = 24.97, 30.25 and 37.67 • with an average H of 4.1 ± 0.56 • . For the BADC sample, the addition of large aliphatic chains generates a whole new region around the crystal particles; this can be concluded as the estimated crystallite size is 53% bigger than the original BANC sample. This new aliphatic chains in the crystalline surface diminish the crystallinity of the modified cellulose as the morphology is altered . In Fig.  (upper right) the deconvoluted peaks for the BADC sample shows a new low-intensity peak at 2Â = 7.99 • that is in the range of the associated diffraction of aliphatic chains for a number of carbons higher than 7 . There are also new peaks at 2Â = 25.26 and 28.44 • that broaden the base of the peaks corresponding to cellulose at the 0 0 2 plane. Surface modification increases the hydrophobicity of cellulose fibers; contact angle provides further information respecting the interaction between the surface of the CNC and CNF and the hydrophobic agent. Table  presents the contact angles (Â <sub>w</sub> ) of cellulose after bleaching as well as modified CNC and CNF. When comparing Â <sub>w</sub> for BAST and BABP, it can be seen a decay on contact angle, this proves the typical hydrophilic character of cellulose. The increase in Â <sub>w</sub> is related to the topology of the surface, either because of the size of the particle avoid the surface roughness or because of the reaction of hydroxyl groups with non-polar particles, even though during surface modification not all hydroxyl groups may react, the possibility of water molecules to penetrate the substrate when dealing at nano-scale is reduced. It can be seen in the BADC sample that the hydrophobic character is increased (Â <sub>w</sub> ∼81.06 • ), while for unmodified bleached cellulose was ∼31.74 • . In case of the ATS modified cellulose, it can be observed a n increase in the surface hydrophobicity of ∼31.45 • more than unmodified cellulose, but still is less than in the case of BADC, this is related to the features associated with the components of the respective modification, as well as with the specific surface of the particle; nano-scale cellulose has more hydroxyl groups to react with, this groups have strong hydrogen bonding with the surface modification agent that generates a shield against water sorption .\n",

      "Table  presents the data corresponding to ultimate tensile strength and strain at break results for the different elaborated composites and Fig.  shows characteristic Tensile-Stress graphs for each composite. The addition of anisotropic material to the polymeric matrix influences the performance in uniaxial stress . It can be observed a considerable decrease of the mechanical properties when adding cellulose without any surface modification in composites reinforced with bleached pulp, cellulose nanofibers and cellulose nanocrystals, in which ultimate tensile strength (UTS) presents a decrease from the 45.29 MPa that has the PLA without any filler; this is accentuated as the percent of filler is increased, reaching a drop of approximately 25% when the filler reaches 2% of the composite. In general, the behavior of composites under uniaxial   stress is similar to the obtained in previous publications, with an increase in the UTS and a decrease in the strain at fracture when cellulosic fillers are added . Qualitative analysis shows differences with previously reported works with another type of cellulose modifications in which tensile stress and modulus are higher but the strain at break is considerably lower  this kind of variations and the ones presented in this wok reflect the importance that the surface modification of cellulose has in the elaboration of composites. In case of BANF and BANC, both have similar UTS values and are higher than those of bleached pulp. On the other hand, PLA composites reinforced with modified nano-particles have better UTS than any other and are slightly better in the case of BADC. With regard to the strain at fracture, ductility of PLA is decreased when mixed with more crystalline material, this particularity can be observed with more clearness in the PLA-BANC composite in which the average maximum elongation is dropped by an average of 48% from the unfilled PLA, as the stronger bonds between the highly crystalline cellulose inhibit the elongation of the fiber. The addition of noncrystalline components to the surface of CNF and CNC enhances the interaction between the filler and the matrix, allowing a better displacement in the axial direction under tension, with strain being increased by ∼18% in the case of 0.5% BADC and ∼25% in the case of 0.5% BANS composites; this value gradually descends as the amount of filler represents a higher percent in the composite, as either 1% and 2% concentrations of BANS and BADC have lower values for maximum strain than PLA without fillers. The behavior of all composites shows a mechanical decay when the amount of filler is increased, this situation can be related with the morphology and the composition of the filler as amorphous parts of BABP, BANF and BAST; lignin content in BAST and coupling agents in BADC and BANC benefit the interactions between crystalline cellulose and PLA; but when the share of the filler inside the composite is increased, the anisotropy characteristic to organic fillers in polymeric matrices, gets a major role in the response of the composite to uniaxial stress, generating more dislocations inside the composite. Furthermore, higher amount of filler material can generate agglomerations that result in a deterioration of tensile stress transfer between matrix and filler, generating a more brittle structure .\n",

Bulk PLA presents a T <sub>g</sub> of 63.22 • C and Tm 175.66 • C this results are similar to those reported in previous works . Changes in T <sub>g</sub> are not significant between different composites, in more crystalline reinforcements such as silanized nanofibers or cellulose nanocrystals it can be observed a slight variation in the T <sub>c</sub> (between 3 and 5 • C) this changes and the increase of the enthalpy of fusion show a good nucleation of the cellulose crystallites enhancing the chain flow of PLA around the crystals whilst the crystallinity and the melting temperature is not highly affected.\n",

      "Six different composites were elaborated using PLA as a matrix and blue agave bagasse as raw material. To study the relevance of composition and surface modification in natural fibers, different chemical and mechanical treatments were performed. The analysis of composites made with the same material throughout the complete process can help to determine the relevance and feasibility of the treatments and then decide if whether or not is worthy. Hydrophilic character of cellulose surface was modified with 3aminopropyl triethoxysilane in case of nanofibers and dodecanoyl chloride in case of nanocrystals. The behavior toward contact angle and tensile tests showed the potential of these modifications as suitable methods to enhance mechanical properties and hydrophobicity because of the formation of non-polar covalent bonding between free hydroxyl and coupling agents, also enhancing dispersion inside the matrix, this has an important potential in creating barrier materials to avoid contact with water. Exists an inversely proportional relation between the amount of filler and the uniaxial mechanical properties, this can be related to agglomerations and the anisotropy of the filler inside the matrix, also the addition of nano-scale particles enhanced the interaction between matrixfiller. Thermal properties showed a better crystallization of the PLA chains when reinforcements were added without affecting the final crystallinity of the polymer.\n"
