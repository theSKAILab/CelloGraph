NEW SECTION: 1.  Introduction  (Level: 1)


NEW PARA:
	NEW SENTENCE: Cellulose  is  the  most  abundant  biopolymer  available  in  nature,  since  it  is  one  of  the  major  components  of  the  cell  walls  of  most  of  the  plants  [1].
	NEW SENTENCE:  It  is  a  homopolymer  of  anhydroglucose,  with  the  glucose  residues  linked  in  a  ß-1,4  fashion  [2].
	NEW SENTENCE:  Cell  walls  of  plant  cells  attribute  their  mechanical  strength  to  cellulose.
	NEW SENTENCE:  Cellulose  owes  its   structural  properties  to  the  fact  that  it  can  retain  a  semi-crystalline  state  of  aggrega- tion  even  in  an  aqueous  environment,  which  is  unusual  for  a  polysaccharide  [3,  4].

NEW PARA:
	NEW SENTENCE: As  far  as  cellulose  based  products  are  concerned,  paperboard  and  paper  are  the  most  commonly  used  ones  [5].
	NEW SENTENCE:  Smaller  amounts  of  cellulose  when  processed  under  appropriate  conditions,  can  be  converted  to  a  wide  variety  of  derivatives,  these  can  be  used  in  manufacture  of  few  commercial  products  like  cellophane  and  rayon  [6].

NEW PARA:
	NEW SENTENCE: Since  cellulose  is  a  homopolymer  of  a  glucose  derivative,  it  is  a  great  source  of  fermentable  sugar.
	NEW SENTENCE:  It  is  cultivated  in  the  form  of  energy  crops  for  the  production  of  ethanol,  ethers,  acetic  acid,  etc.
	NEW SENTENCE:  Besides  energy  requirements  the  industrial  demands  of  cellulose  are  fulfilled  by  wood  pulp  and  cotton  crops  [7].

NEW PARA:
	NEW SENTENCE: Cellulose  also  fulfils  the  dietary  requirements  of  some  animals,  particularly  ruminants  and  termite,  they  can  digest  cellulose  with  help  of  symbiotic  microor- ganisms  present  in  their  gut,  while  some  organisms  secrete  a  group  of  enzymes  called  cellulases  to  aid  the  degradation  of  cellulose  molecules  [8].
	NEW SENTENCE:  Human  beings  are  unable  to  digest  cellulose  due  to  lack  of  cellulases,  thus  cellulose  acts  as  a  hydrophilic  bulking  agent  for  faeces  and  potentially  aids  in  defecation  [9].

NEW SECTION: 2.  Overview  (Level: 1)


NEW PARA:
	NEW SENTENCE: Among  the  various  raw  materials  which  nature  has  placed  at  our  disposal  for  industrial  purposes,  cellulose  has  from  time  immemorial  occupied  a  prominent  position.
	NEW SENTENCE:  Its  abundance  is  attributed  to  the  constant  photosynthetic  cycles  taking  place  in  higher  plants,  which  can  synthesize  around  1011  ±  1012  tons  of  cellulose  in  a  rather  pure  form.
	NEW SENTENCE:  Since  time  immemorial  it  has  served  mankind  either  as  a  con- struction  material  or  as  a  versatile  starting  material  for  chemical  reactions  for  the  production  of  artificial  cellulose  based  threads  and  biofilms  as  well  as  for  produc- tion  of  a  variety  of  stable  cellulose  derivatives  which  are  used  for  various  industrial  and  domestic  applications  [10].
	NEW SENTENCE:  Cellulose  was  used  for  various  biochemical  conver- sions  even  before  its  polymeric  nature  was  recognized  and  well  understood.
	NEW SENTENCE:  In  the  process  of  recognizing  and  understanding  its  polymeric  structure,  it  led  to  the  discovery  of  nitrocellulose,  synthesis  of  organo-soluble  cellulose  acetate  and  the  preparation  of  Schweizer’s  reagent  (first  cellulose  solvent).
	NEW SENTENCE:  Another  area  of  great  interest  was  nanocellulose,  the  nanostructure  of  cellulose  has  proven  to  be  advanta- geous  because  of  its  applications  in  a  variety  of  fields  [11,  12].

NEW PARA:
	NEW SENTENCE: Due  to  such  great  economical  significance  of  tree  cellulose,  the  current  scientific  focus  is  more  towards  cellulose  biosynthesis  as  it  is  still  not  well  understood  [13].
	NEW SENTENCE:  Most  of  the  recent  findings  concerning  the  molecular  mechanism  of  cellulose  biosynthesis  in  higher  plants  resulted  from  research  in  model  herbaceous  plants  and  fibre  crops  and  have  been  reviewed  recently.

	NEW SENTENCE:  The  first  synthesis  of  cellulose  in  vitro  is  reported  as  the  cellucellulase—cellulose  formation  by  catalyzed  cellobiosyl  fluoride  and  the  chemosynthesis  was  processed  in  a  ring  opening  polymerization  of  the  d-glucose  moieties  [16].
	NEW SENTENCE:  A  lot  of  research  is  ongoing  in  the  field  and  study  of  cellulose  over  the  past  decade.
	NEW SENTENCE:  The  structure  and  properties  of  cellulose  are  quintes- sential  to  perform  modifications  and  processing  of  cellulose  on  the  whole.

NEW PARA:
	NEW SENTENCE: The  structure  of  cellulose  has  been  constantly  a  subject  requiring  intensive  research  as  it  is  formed  by  the  hydrogen  bonds  between  the  network  of  hydroxy  groups  [17].
	NEW SENTENCE:  The  progress  was  for  more  than  a  100  years  of  intensive  development  on  structure  analysis  methods  like  electron  microscopy,  X-ray  diffraction  and  high   resolution  solid  state  NMR  spectroscopy.

	NEW SENTENCE:  The  CH _{2} OH  group  is  positioned  relative  to  the  C4  and  C5  bonds  along  with  a  shear  relativity  with  O5–C5  bonds.
	NEW SENTENCE:  The  solid  state  is  equally  likely  to  be  represented  in  the  crystal- line  (high  order)  and  amorphous  (low  order).
	NEW SENTENCE:  The  crystal  structure  in  particular  is  determined  by  the  X-ray  diffraction  using  a  monoclinic  unit  cell  which  is  made  up  of  two  cellulose  chains  in  a  parallel  orientation  and  two  fold  screw  axis  [18].
	NEW SENTENCE:  The  investigations  with  respect  to  the  electron  microbeam  diffraction,  combined  X-ray  and  neutron  diffraction  have  clearly  indicated  that  the  cellulose  crystalline  structures  have  a  triclinic  and  monoclinic  unit  cell.

NEW SECTION: 5.1  Bacterial  cellulose  (Level: 2)


NEW PARA:
	NEW SENTENCE: Although  cellulose  is  mainly  produced  by  plants,  many  bacteria,  especially  those  belonging  to  the  genus  Gluconacetobacter  are  involved  in  the  production  of  a  very  peculiar  form  of  cellulose  with  mechanical  and  structural  properties  that  can  be  exploited  in  numerous  applications.
	NEW SENTENCE:  Bacterial  cellulose  are  usually  pro- duced  by  Gluconacetobacter  hansenii  UCP1619  using  the  Hestrin-Schramm  (HS)  medium.
	NEW SENTENCE:  But  there  are  few  limitations  associated  with  bacterial  cellulose  like  the  production  cost  is  high,  use  of  expensive  culture  media,  poor  yields,  down- stream  processing,  and  operating  costs.
	NEW SENTENCE:  Bacterial  cellulose  can  also  be  produced  by  bacteria  from  genera  Sarcina,  and  Agrobacterium  [19].

	NEW SENTENCE:  The  extraction  of  cellulose  from  SCB  was  inves- tigated  using  steam  explosion  and  xylanase  based  environmentally  friendly  pre- treatment  for  reducing  chemical  bleaching  and  to  determine  the  characteristics  of  cellulose  from  sugarcane  bagasse.
	NEW SENTENCE:  SCB  is  a  low  value  agriculture  residue  and  about  40–50%  of  bagasse  is  the  glucose  polymer  cellulose.
	NEW SENTENCE:  There  are  several  approaches  to  pretreat  lignocellulosic  materials  to  extract  cellulose  such  as  steam  explosion,  solvent  extraction  and  alkaline  treatment.

NEW SECTION: 6.1.1.1  Methodology  (Level: 3)


NEW PARA:
	NEW SENTENCE: Cellulose  is  extracted  from  SCB  by  using  steam  explosion  and  xylanase  pre- treatment  and  bleaching  process.
	NEW SENTENCE:  The  dried  SCB  treated  with  steam  explosion  at  a  pressure  13  bar  (195°C)  for  15  minutes  to  obtain  steam  exploded  SCB  fibres.
	NEW SENTENCE:  Then,  the  steam  exploded  SCB  is  treated  with  20  μg  of  xylanase  using  fibre  to  liquor  ratio  of  1:10  for  1  hour  at  50°C  under  constant  agitation.
	NEW SENTENCE:  Then,  dried  steam  exploded  SCB  is  treated  with  xylanase  (fibre  to  liquor  ratio  of  1:10)  and  then  bleached  with  0.7%  sodium  chlorite  (NaClO _{2} )  adjusted  to  a  pH  of  4  by  the  addition  of  weak  acetic  acid  at  70°C  for  1  hour.
	NEW SENTENCE:  Sodium  chlorite  and  acetic  acid  at  the  same  loading  were  added  to  the  reaction  every  1  hour  till  the  cellulose  turns  white.
	NEW SENTENCE:  The  cellulose  fibres  thus  obtained  would  then  filtrated,  washed  with  distilled  water  until  the  pH  of  water  neutral  and  dried  at  55°C  for  24  hours.
	NEW SENTENCE:  The  steam  explosion  process  includes  saturating  the  dry  material  with  steam  at  elevated  pressure  and  temperature  fol- lowed  by  sudden  release  of  pressure,  resulting  in  substantial  resistance  of  degraded  lignin  fragments,  facilitates  the  release  of  lignin,  which  is  then  readily  available  for  further  bleaching  and  thereby  increases  the  efficiency  of  the  bleaching  process  Thus,  the  use  of  enzymes  to  treat  pulp  before  applying  chemical  bleaching  help  to  reduce  chemical  required  in  bleaching  stage,  breakdown  of  lignocellulosic  structure,  hydrolysis  of  the  hemicelluloses  fraction,  depolymerization  of  the  lignin  compo- nents  and  defibrillization.
	NEW SENTENCE:  In  terms  of  bleaching  treatments,  chlorine-based  chemi- cals  were  typically  used  for  bleaching  process  resulting  in  chemical  hazard  released  into  environmental.
	NEW SENTENCE:  Xylanases  are  glycosyl  hydrolase  that  can  catalyse  the  hydrolysis  of  β-1,  4-glycosidic  bonds  in  xylan  by  means  of  double  displacement  mechanical  reaction.
	NEW SENTENCE:  This  treatment  improves  accessibility  of  bleaching  chemical  to  the  pulp  by  decreasing  diffusion  [29]  (Table  1).

	NEW SENTENCE:  This  rice  husk  can  be  put  into  best  use  by  exploitation  of  its  cellulose  content.
	NEW SENTENCE:  Rice  husk  comprises  of  33%  cellulose,  26%  hemicellulose,  and  7%  lignin.
	NEW SENTENCE:  Thus,  the  use  of  rice  husk  as  the  primary  source  for  producing  cellulose  fibres  and  nanocrystals  is  efficient.
	NEW SENTENCE:  The  strategy  is  to  extract  cellulose  fibres  from  the  rice  husk  using  alkali  and  bleaching  treatments.

	NEW SENTENCE: •  Bone  and  connective  tissue  repair:  Nanocellulose  are  promising  materials  for  the  culture  of  various  cells  including  osteoblasts  and  chondroblasts  indicating  that  they  have  potential  for  bone  tissue  regeneration  and  healing.
	NEW SENTENCE:  A  membrane  of  BC  and  hydroxyapatite  was  developed  as  biomaterial  for  potential  bone  regeneration,  which  delivered  prone  growth  of  osteoblast  cells,  high  level  of  alkaline  phosphatase  activity  and  greater  bone  nodule  formation.
	NEW SENTENCE:  It  was  also  found  that  HAp  crystals  are  partially  substituted  with  carbonate  resembling  natural  bones  [45–47].

NEW SECTION: 8.  Conclusion  (Level: 1)


NEW PARA:
	NEW SENTENCE: From  the  chapter  we  can  conclude  that  cellulose  is  a  highly  versatile  polymer  which  is  easy  to  manufacture  and  extract.
	NEW SENTENCE:  Its  application  in  multiple  fields  has  been  discussed  above.
	NEW SENTENCE:  With  increasing  population,  demand  and  technological  innovations,  renewable  energy  is  gradually  becoming  imperative  aspect  of  resource  conservation  and  overall  environmental  health.
	NEW SENTENCE:  Although  various  other  polymers  can  be  utilized  for  consumables,  biomedical  and  pharmaceutical  applications,  the  marked  advantage  of  cellulose  is  that  it  is  a  biodegradable  and  environmentally  friendly  material.
	NEW SENTENCE:  The  intensive  research  on  the  chemistry  of  the  compound,  has  resulted  in  the  production  of  a  wide  variety  of  biodegradable  products  with  a  plethora  of  applications.
	NEW SENTENCE:  An  improved  information  of  the  many  structural  levels  in  which  cellulose  partakes  will  allow  us  to  understand  better  practise  of  this  excep- tional  and  metastable  molecular  assembly  produced  by  plant  metabolic  pathways.
	NEW SENTENCE:  We  have  placed  emphasis  on  the  diverse  applications  of  cellulose  to  promote  more  innovations  that  aim  to  bridge  the  gap  between  the  amounts  of  cellulosic  waste  and  its  optimum  utilization.
	NEW SENTENCE:  Large  amounts  of  cellulose  based  wastes  are  produced  in  every  community  across  the  world,  which  remain  a  largely  untapped  resource.
	NEW SENTENCE:  Research  that  involves  the  conversion  of  this  perceived  waste  into  a  widely  used  commodity  would  have  the  dual  benefit  of  organic  waste  management  and  sustain- able  innovations.

ring  of  lignin.  Yet,  the  cellulose  fibre  did  not  show  the  C═C  stretching  at  that  region.  This  is  an  indication  that  
the  lignin  was  well  removed  by  chemical  process  [30,  32].

The  thermogravimetric  analysis  of  (GBF,  DBF,  DLBF  and  CF)  green  bamboo  fibre,  dewaxed  bamboo  fibre,  
delignified  bamboo  fibre  and  cellulose  fibre,  respectively.  The  weight  loss  rate  was  obtained  from  the  derivative  
thermogravimetric  (DTG)  data.  The  intersection  of  tangents  drawn  from  thermogravimetric  curve,  one  
before  inflection  caused  by  the  degradation  and  another  from  the  cellulose  degradation  step  indicates  the  onset  
degradation  temperature  [30]. 
Figure  6.  
BJH  surface  area  for  four  samples.  It  was  noted  that  there  was  an  increase  in  the  BJH  surface  area  of  GBF  
and  a  decrease  after  DLBF.  The  decreased  surface  area  of  cellulose  fibre  might  be  a  result  of  the  mechanical  
grinding  process  that  creates  smaller  cellulose  fibre  thus  reduced  the  surface  area.  This  result  also  indicates  that  
mechanical  grinding  should  be  avoided  to  obtain  higher  BJH  surface  area.  The  final  cellulose  fibre  showed  that  
BJH  surface  area  is  two  times  greater  than  the  initial  green  bamboo  fibre  [30,  32].
