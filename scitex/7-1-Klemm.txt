NEW PARA: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)In 1838 the French chemist Anselme Payen described a resistant fibrous solid that remains behind after treatment of various plant tissues with acids and ammonia, and after subsequent extraction with water, alcohol, and ether.^{[1]} He determined the molecular formula to be C_{6} H_{10} O_{5} by elemental analysis, and observed the isomerism with starch. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)The term “cellulose” for this plant constituent was first used in 1839 in a  report of the French academy on the work of Payen.^{[2]}

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)Thousands of years prior to the discovery of the “sugar of the plant cell wall”, cellulose was used in the form of wood, cotton, and other plant fibers as an energy source, for building materials, and for clothing. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)Since the Egyptian papyri, a considerable part of human culture has been shaped by  cellulose materials.

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)The formation of cellulose nitrate by reaction with nitric acid^{[3]} and the corresponding technical synthesis of the first thermoplastic polymer material called celluloid (camphor used as plasticizer) by the Hyatt Manufacturing Company in 1870 demonstrated that new materials could be produced on an industrial scale by the chemical modification of cellulose.^{[4]} With this knowledge came an increased use of synthetic fibers based on wood cellulose, instead of native cellulose fibers, for textiles and technical products. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)The first example herein is the production of regenerate cellulose filaments by spinning a solution of cellulose in a mixture of copper( ii) hydroxide and aqueous ammonia, in which tetraamminecopper(^{ii} ) hydroxide (cuprammonium hydroxide) [Cu(NH_{3} )_{4} ](OH)_{2} is formed,^{[5]} followed by the currently most important large-scale technical process in fiber production, the viscose process.^{[6]} In this process, cellulose is transformed into cellulose xanthogenate (see Scheme 16 and Figure 18) followed by spinning its solution in aqueous sodium hydroxide (viscose). 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 2, col 2; End: pg 2, col 2)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 2; End: pg 2, col 2)From the current point of view , cellulose is the most common organic polymer, representing about 1.5 (cid:1) 10^{12} tons of the total annual biomass production, and is considered an almost inexhaustible source of raw material for the increasing demand for environmentally friendly and biocompatible products.^{[7]} W ood pulp remains the most important raw material source for the processing of cellulose, most of which is used for the production of paper and cardboard. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 2; End: pg 2, col 2)Approximately 2 % (_{(cid:1)} 3.2 million tons in 2003) were used for the production of cellulose regenerate fibers and films, as well as for the synthesis of a large number of cellulose esters and ethers. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 2; End: pg 2, col 2)Such cellulose derivatives produced on an industrial scale (see Schemes 16 and 17 in Section 4) are used for coatings, laminates , optical films and sorption media, as well as for property-determining additives in building materials, pharmaceuticals , foodstuffs, and cosmetics.

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)Numerous new applications of cellulose take advantage of its biocompatibility and chirality for the immobilization of proteins,^{[8]} antibodies,^{[9]} and heparin,^{[10]} and for the separation of enantiomeric molecules^{[11]} as well as the formation of cellulose composites with synthetic  polymers and biopolymers.^{[12]} 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)The fascination of the cellulose biopolymer is a result of its specific structure, which is described in more detail in the following section. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)The fusion of both carbohydrate and polymer chemistry in a macromolecule composed of repeating glucose units generates surprising specificity and impressively diverse architectures , reactivities and functions. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)In contrast to carbohydrates of low molar mass , the reactions and properties of cellulose are determined by intermolecular interactions, cross-linking reactions, chain lengths, chainlength distribution, and by the distribution of functional groups on the repeating units and along the polymer chains. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)Cellulose differs from synthetic polymers by virtue of its distinct polyfunctionality , its high chain stiffness, and its sensitivity toward the hydrolysis and oxidation of the chainforming acetal groups, which determine its chemistry and  handling. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 2)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 2)The elucidation of the polymeric structure of cellulose can be traced back to 1920 with the pioneering work of Hermann  Staudinger.^{[13]} Through acetylation and deacetylation of cellulose, he recognized that its structure does not merely consist of an aggregation of d-glucose units. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 2; End: pg 3, col 2)Rather, the glucose units were found to be linked to each other covalently to form long molecular chains. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 2; End: pg 3, col 2)This, along with Staudinger’s research with other chain molecules, marked the discovery of the polymeric state of molecules and of the corresponding reactions that are unique to polymers and represents the  origin of polymer science. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 3, col 2; End: pg 3, col 2)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 2; End: pg 3, col 2)Figure 1 shows the molecular structure of cellulose as a carbohydrate polymer generated from repeating b-d-glucopyranose molecules that are covalently linked through acetal functions between the equatorial OH group of C4 and the C1 carbon atom (b-1,4-glucan), which is, in principle, the manner in which cellulose is biogenetically formed. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 2; End: pg 3, col 2)As a result, cellulose is an extensive, linear-chain polymer with a large number of hydroxy groups (three per anhydroglucose (AGU) unit) present in the thermodynamically preferred^{4} C_{1} conformation. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 2; End: pg 3, col 2)T o accommodate the preferred bond angles of the acetal oxygen bridges , every second AGU ring is rotated^{1808} in the plane. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 2; End: pg 3, col 2)In this manner, two adjacent structural units  define the disaccharide cellobiose. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 3, col 2; End: pg 4, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 2; End: pg 3, col 2)The chain length of cellulose expressed in the number of constituent AGUs (degree of polymerization, DP) varies with the origin and treatment of the raw material. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 2; End: pg 4, col 2)In case of wood  pulp, the values are typically 300 and 1700. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)Cotton and other plant fibers have DP values in the 800–10 000 range, depending on treatment ; similar DP values are observed in bacterial cellulose. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)Regenerate fibers from cellulose contain 250–500 repeating units per chain. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)By acid treatment and cellulasecatalyzed hydrolysis, cellulose can be quantitatively decomposed to d-glucose. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)Partial chain degradation yields powdery cellulose substrates of the microcrystalline cellulose type^{[14]} (such as A vicel) with DP values between 150 and 300. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)A b (1!4) linked glucan with 20–30 repeating units offers all properties  of cellulose.^{[15]} 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)The cellulose chain consists at one end of a d-glucose unit with an original C4-OH group (the nonreducing end) ; the other end is terminated with an original C1-OH group, which is in equilibrium with the aldehyde structure (the reducing end). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)T echnical celluloses , such as bleached wood pulp, contain additional carbonyl and carboxy groups as a result of the isolation and purification processes that play a  significant role in the processing of cellulose.^{[16]} 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)The molecular structure imparts cellulose with its characteristic properties : hydrophilicity , chirality , degradability , and broad chemical variability initiated by the high donor reactivity of the OH groups (Section 3). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)It is also the basis for extensive hydrogen bond networks, which give cellulose a multitude of partially crystalline fiber structures and mor phologies (Section 2). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)The properties of cellulose are therefore determined by a defined hierarchical order in supramolecular  structure and organization. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)Scheme 1 presents the four different pathways by which cellulose is accessed today . 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)As described above, the dominant pathway is the production of cellulose from plants . 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)In the seed hairs of cotton, cellulose is available in almost pure form. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)In contrast, wood cellulose forms a native composite material with lignin and other polysaccharides (hemicelluloses) from which it is isolated by large-scale chemical pulping,  separation, and purification processes. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)Apart from plants, certain bacteria, algae, and fungi produce cellulose as well. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)Because of their specific supramolecular structures, these cellulose forms are frequently used as model substances for further research on cellulose structure, crystallinity , and reactivity , as well as for the development of new materials and biomaterials (Section 6). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)On this basis , the biosynthesis of cellulose has been investigated in detail over the past decades.^{[17]} Therefore, it is known that the biosynthesis of cellulose has been part of the life cycle of  cyanobacteria for over 3.5 billion years.^{[18]} 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 2)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 2)The synthesis of cellulose in vitro should be highlighted as an additional important development in recent years .^{[15]} The first reported cellu-  lase-catalyzed formation of cellulose was based on cellobiosyl fluoride,^{[19]} and the first chemosynthesis was carried out through a ring-opening polymerization of substituted d-glucose pivalate moieties, followed by deprotection  (Section 7).^{[20]} 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 4, col 2; End: pg 4, col 2)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 2; End: pg 4, col 2)A considerable stimulation of scientific and technological research in the field of cellulose has been triggered over the past 10 years in response to the growing global importance in renewable resources and environmentally compatible materials. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 2; End: pg 4, col 2)With its foundations in the knowledge contained in monographs, books and review articles,^{[21]} this review presents important current developments and discusses the aims, strategies, and perspectives in the field of cellulose. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 2; End: pg 4, col 2)The topics highlighted herein were chosen for their current importance to the field of cellulose research and the nature of the innovative impetus associated with a given development ; their selection reflects the experience of the authors. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 2; End: pg 4, col 2)Thus, a collection of current cellulose research and development has been created that combines discussions of structure, synthesis , innovative products, and new frontiers in an updated contribution to the scientific literature. 

NEW SECTION: 2. Structure and Properties of Cellulose in the Solid State and in Solution  (Level: 1)


NEW PARA: (Start: pg 4, col 2; End: pg 5, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 2; End: pg 5, col 2)The hierarchical structure of cellulose, formed by the hydrogen bond network between hydroxy groups, has been the subject of intense research for more than 100 years, marked with frequent controversy over results and a consistent supply of new insight.^{[22]} Directly from the beginning, progress was closely connected with the introduction and continued development of structure-analysis methods, such as X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy , high-resolution^{13} C  solid state NMR spectroscopy , and neutron diffraction  analysis. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)A detailed analysis and modeling of the various structural levels of cellulose is essential for synthetic reaction procedures, and for the controlled structure formation and properties of cellulose-based chemical products (man-made cellulosics). 

NEW SECTION: 2.1. Solid-State Structures of Native Cellulose  (Level: 2)


NEW PARA: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)As shown in the molecular structure represented in Figure 1, the hydroxy groups of b-1,4-glucan cellulose are placed at positions C2 and C3 (secondary , equatorial) as well as C6 (primary). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)The CH_{2} OH side group is arranged in a trans-gauche (tg) position relative to the O5^{(cid:2)} C5 and C4^{(cid:2)} C5 bonds. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)As a result of the supramolecular structure of cellulose, the solid state is represented by areas of both high order (crystalline) and low order (amorphous). 

NEW SECTION: 2.1.1.^{Crystal} Structure  (Level: 3)


NEW PARA: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 2)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 2)As a first approximation, the crystal structure of native cellulose (cellulose I) determined by X-ray diffraction can be described by a monoclinic unit cell (space group P2_{1} ) which  contains two cellulose chains in a parallel orientation with a twofold screw axis.^{[23]} In the 1980s,^{13} C-CP/MAS NMR spectroscopy was used in the initial discovery that native cellulose is present in two different crystalline cellulose I modifications (I_{a} and I_{b} ), which can be found alongside each other ; the I_{a} /I_{b} ratio depends on the origin of the cellulose.^{[24]} Investigations with electron microbeam diffraction^{[25]} and combined X-ray and neutron diffraction^{[26]} recently revealed the corresponding crystalline structures to have triclinic (I_{a} ) and monoclinic (I_{b} ) unit cells. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 2; End: pg 5, col 2)Figure 2 shows a schematic representation of the I_{b} crystal structure. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 2; End: pg 5, col 2)In the side view (Figure 2 b) of the central chains of a unit cell, two intramolecular, chain-stiffening hydrogen bonds are revealed. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 2; End: pg 5, col 2)Notably , one of the most recent reports on the I_{b} structure^{[27]} describes different conformations for neighboring chains as well as different H-bonding systems inside neighboring  molecular layers . 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 5, col 2; End: pg 6, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 2; End: pg 5, col 2)Apart from the thermodynamically less stable cellulose I, cellulose may occur in other crystal structures (cellulose II, III, and IV),^{[21]} of which cellulose II (Figure 2) is the most stable structure of technical relevance. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 2; End: pg 6, col 2)It can be formed from cellulose I by treatment with aqueous sodium hydroxide (mercerization) or by dissolution of the cellulose and  subsequent precipitation/regeneration, as is done in the formation of fiber and film. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 6, col 1; End: pg 6, col 1)This monoclinic crystal structure^{[28]} with two antiparallel chains in the unit cell is characterized by the specific unit cell geometry with a modified H-bonding system. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 6, col 1; End: pg 6, col 1)The alkalization of cellulose is of considerable importance to commercial-scale cellulose production as a method for increasing the reactivity (activation) of subsequent reactions as well as for the mercerization of cotton. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 6, col 1; End: pg 6, col 1)Depending on the concentration of lye, the temperature, and mechanical load, it is possible to convert cellulose I into various crystalline alkali forms , each with a different crystal structure and variable NaOH and water content.^{[29]} All forms will then convert into crystalline “hydrato cellulose” (water cellulose) during washout, and to cellulose II through drying (Figure 3). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 6, col 1; End: pg 6, col 1)It is not yet understood how the parallel chain arrangement of cellulose I undergoes transition into the antiparallel orientation of cellulose II  without an intermediate dispersion of cellulose molecules. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 6, col 1; End: pg 6, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 6, col 1; End: pg 6, col 1)There are currently only a few reports on the structure of noncrystalline random cellulose chain segments.^{[30]} More knowledge in this area is required, as these structure elements have a significant influence on the accessibility and reactivity of cellulose, as well as on the properties of man-made cellulose fibers.

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 7, col 1; End: pg 7, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 7, col 1; End: pg 7, col 1)As the skeletal component in all plants, cellulose is organized in a cellular hierarchical structure. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 7, col 1; End: pg 7, col 1)In combination with the accompanying substances hemicelluloses , lignin, and pectin, this structure leads to the extraordinary properties of native composite materials, such as wood, cotton, flax, and hemp. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 7, col 1; End: pg 7, col 1)Figure 6 schematically illustrates the cell walls of cotton and wood with differently structured layers , in which the secondary cell-wall layer S2 contains the main quantity of  cellulose. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 7, col 1; End: pg 7, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 7, col 1; End: pg 7, col 1)The cellulose molecules organized in the cell walls in the form of microfibrils have characteristic orientations (helix angles), which differ as a function of the cell wall layer, and according to the plant type as well. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 7, col 1; End: pg 7, col 1)Figure 7 shows X-ray fiber diffraction patterns of cotton and bast fibers (flax, hemp, and jute), which reflect the different average orientations of the  crystalline spectra of these natural fibers. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 7, col 1; End: pg 7, col 2)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 7, col 1; End: pg 7, col 1)The lower orientation of the cellulose microfibrils in cotton fibers (helix angle_{(cid:1)} 188) gives rise to a smaller module of elasticity and a higher elongation at breakage compared with bast fibers, which have a much higher microfibril orientation (helix angle_{(cid:1)} 48–58) and fiber strength. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 7, col 1; End: pg 7, col 2)The adaptation of the mechanical properties of wood to environmental conditions through corresponding helix angles is fascinating, and has yet to be rivaled in technical composite materials.^{[37]} However, it is already  possible to adapt the parameters of cellulosic man-made fibers to user requirements through a targeted influence on the orientation (with particular respect to the noncrystalline chain segments). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 7, col 2; End: pg 7, col 2)It is therefore possible to develop man-made cellulose fibers similar to cotton with low orientation (high elongation), and technical fibers with high orientation and a high modulus of elasticity , similar to bast fibers.

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 8, col 1; End: pg 8, col 1)Examples include the shaping of cellulose from spinning solutions ,^{[38]} modification of the synthesis of cellulose derivatives (Section 3) and the properties of water-soluble cellulose ethers (Section 4), which all are dependent on the solution structure. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 8, col 1; End: pg 8, col 1)For this reason, questions regarding the structure of cellulose in solution have been the subject of intense research and discussion over the past decades. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 8, col 1; End: pg 8, col 1)According to Schurz,^{[38a]} a differentiation is made initially between molecularly dispersed and network solutions , to which a portion of gel particles may be added. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 8, col 1; End: pg 8, col 1)Figure 8 illustrates suggested models of the different solution states of cellulose derivatives, which may depend on the type of solvent, polymer concentration, chain length distribution, and the type, pattern, and degree of cellulose substitution.

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 8, col 1; End: pg 8, col 1)As a rule, cellulose derivatives with free OH groups are not molecularly dispersible. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 8, col 1; End: pg 8, col 1)Investigations with partially substituted cellulose carbanilates and benzoates revealed, however, that aggregate-free solutions can occur through specific polymer–solvent (e.g. DMF) interactions.^{[39]} On the other hand, completely substituted products (such as cellulose tricarbanilates) can be molecularly soluble or, owing to strong intermolecular interactions, insoluble as is the case with  trimethylsilyl cellulose with DS 3.0.

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 8, col 2; End: pg 8, col 2)Over the past few years the research group of Burchard, in particular, has carried out extensive fundamental research into the structure of cellulose and cellulose derivatives in solution by means of static and dynamic light scattering.^{[40]} With regioselective modified cellulose ethers, new insight was gained into the entropy effect during the dissolution of  cellulose derivatives (Section 3.2.3).^{[39,} 40] 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 8, col 2; End: pg 8, col 2)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 8, col 2; End: pg 8, col 2)The initial research results on the solution state of cellulose in N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMO) monohydrate as a technically relevant system (Section 5) substantiate the presence of bimodal molecule aggregations with up to 1000 chains, which can be attributed to incomplete dissolution of crystal structures of the starting cellulose material.^{[41]} In the first approximation, the average number of molecules in the smaller aggregates corresponds to that of crystallites (50–100), whereas the average number of molecules in larger aggregates correlates with the number of molecules found in a microfibril (250–1000).^{[42]} In a ternary solvent system composed of NMMO , water, and diethylenetriamine [bis-(2-aminoethyl)-amine] , cellulose is molecularly soluble within a temperature range of 25–60 8C. Therefore, the average molar mass and other properties of the dissolved molecules could be determined by means of light scattering.^{[43]}

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 8, col 2; End: pg 8, col 2)Owing to chain stiffness, cellulose and certain cellulose derivatives in solutions of higher concentration may form cholesteric (chiral-nematic) structures . 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 8, col 2; End: pg 8, col 2)Since the discovery of the lyotropic liquid-crystalline state of hydroxypropyl cellulose in water,^{[44]} a multitude of cellulose derivatives were found, which produce lyotropic or thermotropic liquidcrystalline phases .^{[45]} Chiral-nematic films and gels are formed from the solutions . 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 8, col 2; End: pg 8, col 2)The influence of the solvent and of the chain stiffness on the pitch and handedness of the  chiral-nematic structures was examined.^{[46]}

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)The insolubility of cellulose in water and in most organic solvents caused by its supramolecular structure is the reason behind the fact that all commercially available products are currently produced through reactions of cellulose in the solid, or more or less swollen state (heterogeneous reactions).^{[49]} Because each repeating unit of cellulose has three hydroxy groups available for reaction, and the stability of the chainforming acetal groups toward various reagents, oxygen, and mechanical and thermal load is limited, additional questions emerge over substituent distribution in the product and over  chain degradation during synthesis . 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)In case of heterogeneous reactions, the accessibility and reactivity of the OH groups are clearly determined by hydrogen bond-breaking activation steps (through alkaline compounds such as NaOH, Section 2.1.1)^{[50]} and by interaction with the reaction media (e.g. swelling).^{[51]} Thus, the “linear” transfer of the typical reactions of organic chemistry to cellulose is not easily done. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)However, the control of cellulose activation and of the type of heterogeneous reaction permits effective synthesis of cellulose products with desired degrees of reaction, reproducible substitution patterns , and targeted properties at both the laboratory and production scales. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)There remain important aspects of the synthesis procedure that are understood only partially . 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)Therefore, a lot of experience and the right “feeling” are still required in  cellulose syntheses. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)Through the use of specific cellulose solvents,^{[21a]} which disrupt hydrogen bonds and thus dissolve the adducts formed, the influence of the supramolecular structure of cellulose on the reaction procedure is eliminated almost completely . 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)In this context, a solution of LiCl in DMA (DMA/LiCl) is one of the most important solvent systems for cellulose in organic syntheses^{[52]} as well as for analytical purposes .^{[53]} The structure of this binary medium, the mechanism of dissolution, the influence of water on the dissolving activity , and the state of  dissolution of cellulose have been investigated in detail.^{[40,} 54]

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 12, col 1; End: pg 12, col 1)This connection exploits the fact that the activation of the cellulose by aqueous sodium hydroxide is dependent on the concentration of base and on the lateral dimensions of the ordered areas.

NEW SECTION: 5.1. Present Situation  (Level: 2)


NEW PARA: (Start: pg 20, col 2; End: pg 21, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 20, col 2; End: pg 20, col 2)The most important segment by volume in the chemical– technical processing of cellulose is represented by products made of regenerated cellulose (man-made cellulosics), which primarily include regenerated fibers, but also films, membranes, and sponges. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 20, col 2; End: pg 20, col 2)At an annual world production of about 2.2 million tons (2002), the viscose method,^{[113]} well over 100 years old, still dominates production methods in which pulp with CS_{2} is converted into cellulose xanthogenate as a metastable intermediate. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 20, col 2; End: pg 20, col 2)The xanthogenate is soluble in aqueous sodium hydroxide, and can be formed as a viscose solution in a wet process. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 20, col 2; End: pg 21, col 2)After precipitation of the shaped  product, the substituent is cleaved off, and high-purity cellulose is regenerated. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 21, col 1; End: pg 21, col 1)Viscose fibers (Rayon) have excellent properties for a broad product range, from wet-strength cottonlike textile fibers (Modal fibers) to technical fibers in the form of cord (Rayon) for use in high-performance tires . 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 21, col 1; End: pg 21, col 1)Viscose technology is still in use today for film (cellophane) production, which is particularly important for food casing  products. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 21, col 1; End: pg 21, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 21, col 1; End: pg 21, col 1)The viscose route, however, is technologically complex (see processing scheme in Figure 18), requires highest-quality dissolving pulp, and leads to problematic environmental loads from the use of CS_{2,} heavy metal compounds (in the precipitation process), and resultant by-products. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 21, col 1; End: pg 21, col 1)T o decrease emissions and to meet the environmental standards , different methods can be applied. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 21, col 1; End: pg 21, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 21, col 1; End: pg 21, col 1)The first (and rather unspectacular) variant to this end is to improve the existing viscose production by optimizing the consumption of chemicals , with particular regard to minimizing the use of CS_{2} .^{[114]} This variant also includes the refitting of exhaust gas and waste water cleaning equipment, which has been implemented continuously in the viscose industries in western Europe, where today the emissions either meet or lie below the threshold values in place.^{[115]} It is advantageous that existing facilities can still be used for the production of highly sophisticated types of fiber that have been introduced to the market. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 21, col 1; End: pg 21, col 1)The increased cost of viscose technology incurred by the purification of exhaust gas and waste water is a disadvantage that must be weighed against the product advantages, in particular, in case of the installation of new  production capacities . 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 21, col 1; End: pg 21, col 2)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 21, col 1; End: pg 21, col 1)Alternate processing technologies should be simpler than the viscose process, and environmentally hazardous materials and side products in general must be avoided (Figure 18). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 21, col 1; End: pg 21, col 2)An alternate derivatization method that has been developed to commercial maturity without the use of sulfur -containing  compounds , but that retains the viscose spinning technology , is the CarbaCell process,^{[116]} in which a new reaction variant employs urea to convert cellulose into cellulose carbamate, which can be subsequently processed on existing viscose  spinning systems . 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 21, col 2; End: pg 21, col 2)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 21, col 2; End: pg 21, col 2)The direct dissolution and shaping of cellulose without derivatization is possible with copper ammonia technology ,^{[117]} which originated as a very early spinning route of cellulose (Cupro silk, Cuprophane). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 21, col 2; End: pg 21, col 2)It is rarely used anymore, as it poses environmental hazards . 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 21, col 2; End: pg 21, col 2)Among others, it has been suggested that the dissolution and shaping of cellulose could be carried out by DMA/LiCl or zinc chloride and in aqueous solution with NaOH (CELSOL process),^{[118]} or phosphoric acid as a direct solvent to spin high-strength cellulose filaments.^{[119]} However, the most advanced development took place beginning in the 1980s with a process based on the NMMO monohydrate solvent system, which was taken to commercial maturity and which made the current industrial breakthrough known as the Lyocell process .^{[120]} This process offers the potential for a revolutionary development in cellulose processing, as it is comparatively simple (Figure 18) and is practically free from emissions as almost all the solvent involved is recovered. 

NEW SECTION: 5.2. The CarbaCell Process  (Level: 2)


NEW PARA: (Start: pg 21, col 2; End: pg 21, col 2)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 21, col 2; End: pg 21, col 2)The starting point of this development is founded in previous studies^{[121]} of the transformation of cellulose with urea (after urea breakdown) to form cellulose carbamate (Scheme 18), which is soluble and shapeable in sodium  hydroxide solution. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 21, col 2; End: pg 21, col 2)The patented CarbaCell technology is based on a synthesis of the cellulose carbamate in xylene as a transfer medium.^{[116]} The technical sequence is similar to the viscose method (Figure 18). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 21, col 2; End: pg 21, col 2)The starting cellulose material is initially alkalized and pre-ripened (partial chain degradation) ; in the synthesis stage it is subsequently derivatized and dissolved in sodium hydroxide solution. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 21, col 2; End: pg 21, col 2)The spinning solution is filtered and deaerated prior to wet spinning in an acidic precipitation bath, followed by a salt-containing alkaline decomposition bath for the hydrolysis of the carbamate groups at elevated temperature. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 21, col 2; End: pg 21, col 2)The structural changes of the cellulose during processing are clearly illustrated in Figure 19  with^{13} C-CP/MAS solid-state NMR spectra. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 21, col 2; End: pg 22, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 21, col 2; End: pg 22, col 2)Depending on the derivatization procedure, the transformation of the alkalized cellulose with urea leads to structures that are similar to the cellulose modifications II and IV , and that have either blocklike or statistic distributions  of the substituents along the cellulose chain.^{[38e]} Apart from  the use of the innocuous urea as a substitute for the toxic CS_{2} , the advantage of the carbamate process is that the cellulose carbamate is relatively stable at room temperature, which permits storage times of more than a year without loss of quality . 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 22, col 1)Thus, the synthesis of cellulose carbamate can be carried out on a large scale in a central location, from which products can then be shipped to decentralized facilities for processing (such as spinning factories). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 22, col 1)Industrial tests have shown that cellulose carbamate can be processed without any problems on viscose spinning machines . 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 22, col 1)Despite the advantages of the carbamate process , which could possibly be used for other products such as high-absorbent nonwovens , hollow fibers, sponges , and carpet cleaners, industrial cellulose carbamate production sites have not yet been established. 

NEW SECTION: 5.3. The NMMO (Lyocell) Process  (Level: 2)


NEW PARA: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 22, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 22, col 1)Owing to its strong N^{(cid:2)} O dipole, N-methylmorpholine-Noxide (NMMO) in combination with water can dissolve cellulose without prior activation or derivatization. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 22, col 1)With a water content of 13.3 % by mass and a decreased melting point of about 74 8C, NMMO monohydrate is significant as a solvent, from a technical standpoint, compared with pure NMMO . 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 22, col 1)The breakthrough of this system for technical applications came with the introduction of stabilizers such as propylgallate, which suppresses the radical separation of the NMMO and scission of the cellulose chain at the required processing temperatures .^{[123]} Solutions with cellulose content of up to 23 % can be produced starting with the dispersion of conventional cellulose in NMMO with a high water content (such as 50 %). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 22, col 1)Subsequent concentration of the suspension at higher temperature until the NMMO monohydrate composition is made permits dissolution of the cellulose. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 22, col 1)In the ternary phase diagram of Figure 20, the path of the cellulose during the solutions production and the technological stages  of the NMMO processes (cf. Figure 18) can be followed. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 22, col 2)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 22, col 2)The shaping of the cellulose/NMMO/water solution into fibers takes place at temperatures between 80 and 120 8C, at which the semiliquid system (dope), with a cellulose content  of 8–23 %, is extruded from a nozzle over an air gap with a length of 10–250 mm into an aqueous precipitation bath. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 2; End: pg 22, col 2)There, the cellulose precipitates almost instantaneously . 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 2; End: pg 22, col 2)In a closed circle, the industrial recovery of NMMO is 99.6–99.7 % from the precipitation bath, with its upgrade and cleaning by an ion-exchange process. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 2; End: pg 22, col 2)In the dry jet/wet-spinning process , any deformation in the region of the nozzle and the following air gap section elicits a significant influence on structure formation (particularly the orientation state) of the thread and its resulting properties. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 2; End: pg 22, col 2)The fundamentals of crystallization and structure formation of the cellulose after precipitation from NMMO solutions were initially analyzed by Chanzy and co-workers,^{[125]} and Dub(cid:2) and co-workers.^{[126]} A list of the extensive literature concerning the structure formation of cellulose regenerated materials made from NMMO solutions  available since the seminal work is given in Ref.  [42] 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 22, col 2; End: pg 22, col 2)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 2; End: pg 22, col 2)Compared with conventional viscose fibers, today(cid:3)s generation of commercial Lyocell fibers spun from NMMO solution have outstanding properties in certain respects, such as strength in both wet and dry states, modulus of elasticity , sorption behavior, wearing properties, gloss , and touch. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 2; End: pg 22, col 2)However, the distinct wet fibrillation behavior is predominantly disadvantageous , and its suppression still requires additional processing, such as subsequent cross-linking steps  (Section 5.5). 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 22, col 2; End: pg 22, col 2)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 2; End: pg 22, col 2)The fact that the cellulose/NMMO/water solution can be deformed in the nozzle and the air gap, similar to a melt, opened up the initial possibility to produce cellulose films in a blow-extrusion process^{[127]} (basic sketch in Figure 21). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 2; End: pg 22, col 2)Spun fleeces (melt-blown nonwovens)^{[128]} can also be manufactured analogously to synthetic polymers (polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyethyleneterephthalate) shaped from melt. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 2; End: pg 22, col 2)The blown-film process permits the setting of longitudinal and transverse properties by means of the corresponding orientation states, a feature still not feasible in this manner for cellulose films, on the one hand. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 2; End: pg 22, col 2)On the other hand, the morphology and pore structure of the film can be influenced by the subsequent precipitation process, which is not possible in melt-extruded films from synthetic polymers. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 2; End: pg 22, col 2)This results in versatile application possibilities for the blown films from cellulose, which range from packaging materials and food  casings, to dialysis membranes . 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 22, col 2; End: pg 23, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 2; End: pg 23, col 2)Another advantage of the NMMO process is that less  expensive cellulose of lower purity (higher hemicellulose  content) can be used ; this is a significant benefit for the development and production of melt-blown nonwovens .^{[128]} The pioneering significance of the cellulose/NMMO/water system is also made clear by the fact that apart from classical fibers and films, numerous new products can be produced, thus opening a gigantic field of application for the sustainable polymer raw material cellulose. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 23, col 1; End: pg 23, col 1)Developments are currently in progress, including lyophane membranes for water purification,^{[124b]} precursor filaments for carbon fibers,^{[129]} and cellulose-based functional materials^{[130]} such as conductive and piezoelectric fibers, ceramic hollow fibers, pearl cellulose for encapsulation, and highly porous materials for various  applications . 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 23, col 1; End: pg 23, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 23, col 1; End: pg 23, col 1)Special emphasis must also be placed on the fact that through the industrially applied Lyocell fiber process and the emission-free technical NMMO recovery system developed in this field, a significant drawback to the previous cellulose technologies has been removed.

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 24, col 1; End: pg 24, col 1)It results from a largely empirical understanding of the complicated processes of cellulose derivative structure formation from solution which have not always been published, and which are mastered today only by a few specialists in industry and research institutes. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 24, col 1; End: pg 24, col 1)The development of new , possibly superior products manufactured through application of the latest environmentally compatible technologies can be realized only through a comparatively thorough understanding of the structure formation process and the connections between manufacturing conditions, structures, and properties.

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 24, col 1; End: pg 24, col 2)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 24, col 1; End: pg 24, col 1)Electron micrographs of ultrathin sections of the various regenerate fibers reveal that textile viscose fibers have a lobed cross-section and a skin–core morphology , whereas the round to oval cross-sectional shapes and the homogeneous morphologies of carbamate and Lyocell fibers are distinctly different, and are similar to each other (Figure 22). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 24, col 1; End: pg 24, col 2)In the latter case, it is apparent that a fast “hard” precipitation takes place without hydrolysis of the carbamate groups, whereas the precipitation conditions of the viscose process are “softer”; the precipitation, the substituent removal, as well as the transport of the reaction products during regeneration take  place as competing processes. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 24, col 2; End: pg 24, col 2)T able 4 shows that the degrees of crystallinity (W AXS , Ruland–V onk method)^{[132]} for carbamate and Lyocell fibers range between 35 and 40 %, above the respective value for viscose fibers of lower crystallinity (_{(cid:1)} 30 %). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 24, col 2; End: pg 24, col 2)A comparison of the crystallite dimensions, also determined by X-ray diffraction and given in T able 4, demonstrates that the Lyocell fiber has narrower and  particularly longer crystallites (in the fiber direction).

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 24, col 2; End: pg 25, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 24, col 2; End: pg 24, col 2)It is clear that the stiff and fibrillating behavior of the Lyocell fibers is caused by their high orientation in the noncrystalline regions—similar to technical fibers—the lowering of which in combination with a decrease in the degree of crystallinity was, and still is, a central task in the continued  development of Lyocell fibers.

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 25, col 1; End: pg 25, col 1)This example demonstrates , that knowledge of fiber structures and an understanding of the structure-forming process are important prerequisites for the development of products with the desired properties. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 25, col 1; End: pg 25, col 1)A wide range of alternate possibilities for influencing fiber structure and properties, including the downstream cross-linking of molecules in the fiber, can be found in the patent literature. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 25, col 1; End: pg 25, col 1)The full potential capacity for such process control, however, has certainly not yet been tapped by the methods currently in use. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 25, col 1; End: pg 25, col 1)Therefore, a more thorough understanding of these structureforming processes is urgently required.

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 25, col 1; End: pg 25, col 1)Symmetrical (identical precipitation baths inside and outside) and asymmetrical (different precipitation baths inside and outside) film structures can be produced without difficulty (Figure 25). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 25, col 1; End: pg 25, col 1)Compared with cellophane and cuprophane films on the market, blown films produced according to the Lyocell process have somewhat lower degrees of crystallinity (_{(cid:1)} 40 %) and only slightly smaller lateral crystallite  dimensions.

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 25, col 1; End: pg 25, col 2)An advantage of the blow-extrusion process, which can be transferred to cellulose films as well, is the ability to control the orientation in the machine direction and transverse  direction without any problems by means of the draw-down and blow-up ratio.

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 26, col 2; End: pg 26, col 2)The synthesis of the bacterial cellulose occurs between the outer and plasma membranes of the cell by a cellulosesynthesizing complex (terminal complex) starting with uridine diphosphate glucose (UDP glucose).^{[136]} This complex is associated with bacterial cell surface pores, which have a diameter of about 3.5 nm. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 26, col 2; End: pg 26, col 2)Cellulose synthase catalyzes the addition of UDP glucose to the end of the growing cellulose chain, which exits the cell as an elementary fibril, and then forms a 3D network with other elementary fibrils through formation of microfibrils and ribbons.^{[136]} Crystallization and polymerization of the elementary fibrils are closely linked.

Upon dissection of the nervus ischiadicus and subsequent reconnection by a microsurgical suture, a protective cover (cuff) of BASYC prevents connective tissue from growing into the nerve gap, and favors the adhesion of the fascicles , which facilitates early regeneration of the nerve and a rapid return of muscle function.

Dieter Klemm received his master’s degree (diploma) in 1964 from the University of Jena, and received his PhD in 1968 from work in the stereospecific synthesis of nitrogen-containing steroids conducted with Prof. G. Drefahl at the Institute of Organic Chemistry. He obtained his habilitation in 1977 after conducting research in synthetic polymer chemistry with H.-H. H(cid:1)rhold. After work in the pharmaceutical industry and initial activities in polysaccharides as a university lecturer, he has been a professor of organic chemistry at the University of Jena 

since 1987. He is associate editor of the journal Cellulose and columnist of Polymer News. In 2004 he became the first German scientist to receive the Anselme Payen Award of the American Chemical Society for contributions to the development of new cellulose-based materials. Hans-Peter Fink studied physics at Rostock University, where he received his diploma in 1973 and his PhD in 1977 under Prof. G. Becherer on X-ray diffraction analysis of glass ceramics. Between 1975 and 1992 he worked at the Institute for Polymer Chemistry in T eltow–Seehof, conducting structural investigations of cellulose which was also the topic of his habilitation (1991, Rostock University). He has been employed at the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Polymer Research since its foundation in 1992, and he currently heads the Division of Natural Polymers of the Institute. He has been awarded repeatedly for his contributions to the field of cellulose research, most recently in 2002, with the Jisuke Hayashi Award of the Cellulose Society of Japan. Brigitte Heublein studied chemistry at the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena and received her master’s degree (diploma) in 1969 with her investigations of cationic polymerization of vinyl monomers. She received her PhD in 1974 from research into the control of cationic polymerizations of vinyl monomers with Prof. G. Heublein at the Institute of Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry, and was associated with that research group until 1989. Since 1990 she has been working in organic natural products and polysaccharide chemistry under the direction of Prof. D. Klemm. Andreas Bohn studied mineralogy at the universities of M(cid:2)nster and Berlin, where he graduated in 1994 from the Hahn–Meitner Institute with a diploma thesis on X-ray and neutron scattering investigations of the structure of proton conductors. Since 1995 he has been working in the department of structure characterization at the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Polymer Research in T eltow and Potsdam (Golm). In 2000 he received his PhD degree with a thesis on X-ray diffraction investigations of the structure and orientation of bacterial cellulose and regenerated cellulose films. He has since headed the group of X-ray structure characterization at the Institute.
