NEW SECTION: 1 Introduction  (Level: 1)


NEW PARA: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)Cellulose is the most abundant natural polymer in the biosphere, with a global production (and decomposition) of ~1.5^{(cid:3)} 10^{12} tons per year, comparable to the planetary reserves of the main fossil and mineral sources [1]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)In addition to the long-standing scientiﬁc interest in cellulose, the use of cellulose as renewable and biodegradable raw material in various applications is a proposed solution to the recent industrial challenge to successfully meet environmental and recycling problems [2]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)Versatile structuring of cellulose by various routes of modiﬁcation, including both physical and chemical methods, has enabled its use in a variety of applications (e.g., ﬁllers, building and coating materials, laminates, papers, textiles, optical ﬁlms, sorption media, viscosity regulators, and even advanced functional materials) [3]. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)The earliest systematic efforts that lead to the discovery of cellulose began in 1837 with the work of the French chemist Anselme Payen, who showed that various plant materials yielded a ﬁbrous substance after puriﬁcation with acid-ammonia treatment and extraction with water, alcohol, and ether. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)The French Academy ﬁnally named the resulting carbohydrate “cellulose” [4]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)Nowadays, there are various processes used to isolate cellulose, for example, the alkaline, bisulﬁte,  and sulfate (kraft-) processes, in combination with thermal and mechanical treatments. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)The different processes result in varying ﬁber strengths of the pulp [5, 6]. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)The aim of this review is to discuss the different structural levels of cellulose and to describe important properties that result from this unique structure. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)Moreover, advanced micro- and nanostructural materials based on cellulose obtained by physical and hydrolytic treatments (top-down approaches) as well as the bottomup elaboration of nanostructures by electrospinning and nanoprecipitation are highlighted. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)Finally, one of the most important paths for the design of highly engineered products, namely chemical modiﬁcation of cellulose (particularly under homogeneous reactions conditions), is summarized with consideration of our own research in the ﬁeld of chemical modiﬁcation of cellulose by advanced organic chemistry. 

NEW SECTION: 2 Sources of Cellulose  (Level: 1)


NEW PARA: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)Cellulose is distributed throughout nature in plants, animals, algae, fungi, and minerals (Fig. 1). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)However, the major source of cellulose is plant ﬁber. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)Cellulose contributes approximately 40% to the carbon fraction in plants, serving as structuring element within the complex architecture of their cell walls. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)Cellulose can occur in pure form in plants but it is usually accompanied by hemicelluloses,  lignins, and comparably small amounts of extractives. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)Wood contains about 40– 50 wt% cellulose. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)Comparable amounts can be found in bagasse (35–45 wt%), bamboo (40–55 wt%), straw (40–50 wt%), and even higher in ﬂax (70–80 wt%), hemp (75–80 wt%), jute (60–65 wt%), kapok (70–75 wt%), and ramie (70–75 wt %). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)Cotton is a fairly pure cellulose source, containing more than 90 wt% [8]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)An impressive amount of cellulose is produced each year, not only in wood ﬁber from trees (ca. 1,750,000 kt world production) but also in annual plants such as bamboo (10,000 kt), cotton linters (18,450 kt), jute (2,300 kt), ﬂax (830 kt), sisal (378 kt), hemp (214 kt), and ramie (100 kt) [9]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)In addition, several fungi and green algae produce cellulose (e.g., Valonia ventricosa, Chaetamorpha melagonicum, Glaucocystis) and some (marine) animals such as ascidians contain cellulose in their outer membrane. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)Moreover, bacteria of the genera Gluconacetobacter, Agrobacterium, Pseudomonas, Rhizobium, and Sarcina can synthesize bacterial cellulose from glucose and various other carbon sources [10, 11]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)Bacterial cellulose, which is produced directly as a ﬁbrous network, contains no lignin, pectin, hemicelluloses, or other biogenic products; it is very highly crystalline and possesses a high degree of polymerization (DP). 

NEW SECTION: 3 Structure of Cellulose 3.1 Molecular Structure  (Level: 1)


NEW PARA: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)Independent of the source, cellulose consists of D-glucopyranose ring units in the ^{4}C_{1} -chair conﬁguration, which exhibits the lowest energy conformation [12]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)Such units are linked by β-1,4-glycosidic bonds that results in an alternate turning of the cellulose chain axis by 180^{(cid:4)} . 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)Cellobiose with a length of 1.3 nm can be considered the repeating unit of cellulose [13]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)Three reactive hydroxyl groups exist in each anhydroglucose unit (AGU) within the cellulose chain, a primary group at C6 and two secondary groups at C2 and C3 that are positioned in the plane of the ring (Fig. 2). 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)As is typical for a polymer formed by “polycondensation,” the chain ends of the cellulose molecule are chemically different [14]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)One end contains an anomeric C atom linked by the glycosidic bonds (nonreducing end) whereas the other end has a D-glucopyranose unit in equilibrium with the aldehyde function (reducing end group).

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 5, col 5)HO OH  O _{O}HO  ^{O}HO OH  O_{O} HO  OH OH  Changes in the molecular structure originate from reactions leading to hydrolysis or oxidation of the cellulose chain. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)Such reactions mainly occur on the surface of the ﬁbrils or in amorphous regions. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)The DP of native cellulose of various origins is in the range of 1,000–30,000, which corresponds to chain lengths of 500–15,000 nm. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)The cellulose samples that are obtained by isolation methods possess DP values ranging between 800 and 3,000 [13]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)Cellulose samples are polydisperse, thus, the DP is an average value. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)There are several techniques that can give information about the molar masses and their distribution, including viscosity measurements, size-exclusion chromatography, and light scattering. 

NEW SECTION: 3.2 Hydrogen Bonding  (Level: 2)


NEW PARA: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)Cellulose possesses various systems of hydrogen bonds, which have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on properties [15]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)For instance, the limited solubility in most solvents, the reactivity of the hydroxyl groups, and the crystallinity of cellulose samples originate from strong hydrogen bonding systems. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)Cellulose also contains hydrophobic areas (around the C atoms) that have a certain inﬂuence on the overall properties, including solubility. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)The three hydroxyl groups of the AGU, the oxygen atoms of the Dglucopyranose ring, and the glycosidic linkage interact with each other within the chain or with another cellulose chain by forming intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)The hydrogen bonds give rise to various three-dimensional arrangements. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)Infrared (IR) [16, 17] and solid state^{13} C-NMR spectroscopy [18] revealed that the OH group at C3 and adjacent ether oxygen of the AGU units form intramolecular bonds together with those between the oxygen atoms in the hydroxyl group at C6 and neighboring hydroxyls linked to C2. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)Together with the β-glycosidic covalent linkage, the intramolecular hydrogen bonds are responsible for the rigidity or stiffness of the cellulose polymer [13]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)As a result, highly viscous solutions are produced from cellulose relative to those obtained from equivalent polysaccharides bonded by α-glycosidic linkages. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)This also leads to a high tendency to crystallize or to form ﬁbrillar structures. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)Intermolecular hydrogen bonding is responsible for the strong interaction between cellulose chains. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)The bonds are produced between adjacent cellulose macromolecules located along the (002) plane in the crystal lattice of cellulose I (native cellulose), mainly between the oxygen atom in C3 and the OH at C6 (see Sect. 3.3) [19]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)Together, the hydrogen bonding, weak C–H–O bonds, and hydrophobic interactions are responsible for the assembly of cellulose in layers, as elucidated by synchrotron X-ray and neutron diffraction experiments [20]. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 6, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)Cellulose II (see Sect. 3.3) shows a different hydrogen bonding system. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 6, col 1)Because of the existence of an intermolecular hydrogen bond between the OH groups of C6 and C2 of another chain, the intramolecular bonding of OH in C2 is avoided and an  intermolecular hydrogen bond of OH–C2 to OH–C2 of the next chain is formed [21]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 6, col 1; End: pg 6, col 1)In comparison to cellulose I, the cellulose II molecules are more densely packed and strongly interbonded and, therefore, cellulose II is less reactive, as commonly observed [13]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 6, col 1; End: pg 6, col 1)Figure 3 shows a scheme of the hydrogen bonding system in cellulose I and II. 

NEW SECTION: 3.3 Crystal Modiﬁcations  (Level: 2)


NEW PARA: (Start: pg 6, col 1; End: pg 6, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 6, col 1; End: pg 6, col 1)The regular structure of cellulose leads to X-ray diffraction patterns that reveal its degree of crystallinity. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 6, col 1; End: pg 6, col 1)There were a number of inconsistencies in the crystalline structure described for different cellulose modiﬁcations after certain treatments [23]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 6, col 1; End: pg 6, col 1)X-ray and NMR experiments conﬁrmed the dimorphism [24]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 6, col 1; End: pg 6, col 1)X-ray diffraction patterns and solid-state^{13} C-NMR revealed cellulose conformations (Figs. 4 and 5) that were used to elucidate the detailed crystalline structure and the basis for transformation in the various allomorphs [25]. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 6, col 1; End: pg 6, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 6, col 1; End: pg 6, col 1)Celluloses from different sources possess comparable crystallinity (i.e., modiﬁcations of cellulose I). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 6, col 1; End: pg 6, col 1)However, solid state^{13} C-NMR studies revealed that cellulose can crystallize with varying proportions of two different phases, named cellulose_{Iα} and Iβ. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 6, col 1; End: pg 6, col 1)Plant cellulose mainly consists of cellulose Iβ, whereas cellulose produced by primitive organisms crystallizes in the_{Iα} phase. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 6, col 1; End: pg 6, col 1)The monoclinic unit cell of cellulose_{Iα} with a space group P2_{1} consists of two cellulose molecules, each containing a cellobiose unit in the 002 corner plane and 002 center plane in a parallel fashion [19]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 6, col 1; End: pg 6, col 1)Cellulose_{Iβ} corresponds to a triclinic symmetry with space group P_{1} containing one chain in the unit cell, as schematically displayed in Fig.  6a. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 6, col 1; End: pg 8, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 6, col 1; End: pg 7, col 17)Cellulose I can be transformed into the thermodynamically stable crystalline  form of cellulose II by regeneration from the dissolved state or mercerization.

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 8, col 1; End: pg 8, col 1)The irreversible transition to cellulose II is used for improving the quality of natural ﬁbers and yarns. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 8, col 1; End: pg 8, col 1)Moreover, the treatment of cellulose with aqueous alkali (mainly aqueous sodium hydroxide) is the key step for activating the polymer prior to heterogeneous chemical modiﬁcation, particularly for commercial etheriﬁcation. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 8, col 1; End: pg 8, col 1)The structure of cellulose II was revised by neutron ﬁber diffraction analysis [27]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 8, col 1; End: pg 8, col 1)Two chains of cellulose are located antiparallel on the 2_{1} axis of the monoclinic cell (Fig. 6b), while the chains are displaced relative to each other by about one fourth of the AGU. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 8, col 1; End: pg 8, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 8, col 1; End: pg 8, col 1)The treatment of cellulose I and II with liquid ammonia and certain amines results in the formation of cellulose III_{I} and III_{II} , respectively, possessing the same unit cell [26]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 8, col 1; End: pg 8, col 1)The structures can easily be reconverted into cellulose I or II by mild heating. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 8, col 1; End: pg 8, col 1)The crystalline structure of cellulose III_{I} can be described as a one-chain unit cell and a P2_{1} space group, with the cellulose chain axis on one of the 2_{1} screw axes of the cells [28]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 8, col 1; End: pg 8, col 1)A single chain of cellulose III_{I} is similar to one of the two chains existing in a crystal of cellulose II. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 8, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 8, col 1; End: pg 8, col 1)Cellulose III can be transformed into cellulose IV_{I} or IV_{II} in glycerol at high temperatures, depending on the starting materials used. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 8, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)However, the conversion is  never quantitative, which complicates complete analysis of the crystallinity [29]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)The space group P_{1} is assumed for both structures. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)In addition to the crystalline domains, there are also amorphous or noncrystalline regions in cellulose, which inﬂuence the physical and chemical properties of celluloses [30]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)Interactions between solid cellulose and water, enzymes, and reactive or adsorptive substances occur ﬁrst at the noncrystalline, amorphous domains or at the surface of cellulose crystals. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)Entire amorphous cellulose samples can be prepared by ball-milling of cellulose [31], deacetylation of cellulose acetate under nonaqueous alkaline conditions [32], or precipitation from nonaqueous cellulose solutions into nonaqueous media avoiding stress [33]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)However, the amorphous structures are usually unstable in the presence of water and form partly crystalline cellulose II. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)Interestingly, it was found that Raman and solid state^{13} CNMR spectra of amorphous and highly crystalline cellulose IV_{II} are almost identical, which conﬁrms the similarity of the secondary structures of the two cellulose types [34]. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)Regarding the use of cellulose and its chemical derivatization, the crystal structures of cellulose I and II are important. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)As far as this author knows, there are no established technical processes nor cellulose-based products using or possessing any other crystalline structures.

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)Cellulose is organized in parallel assemblies of elementary crystallites, which organize into ﬁbers via hydrogen bonding [13]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)Whereas areas of lower order or noncrystalline regions contain turns between neighboring chains, ordered crystallites pack cellulose chains folded in a longitudinal direction. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)The less ordered regions display a relatively lower density and more random orientation [35].

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 11, col 1; End: pg 11, col 1)Compared with plant cellulose, bacterial cellulose (BC) is very pure (contains no hemicelluloses and lignin) and only a very low amount of carbonyl and carboxyl moieties are present [7]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 11, col 1; End: pg 11, col 1)BC possesses high crystallinity (more than 80%), excellent water absorption capacity, and extraordinary mechanical strength, particularly in the wet state, resulting mainly from the presence of nanoﬁbrils of BC rather than microﬁbers of plant cellulose (see Sect. 4). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 11, col 1; End: pg 11, col 1)An important advantage of BC is its in situ moldability (i.e., shaping during biosynthesis) [39].

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 12, col 1; End: pg 12, col 1)Shaping of BC in a static culture by applying a template matrix can yield different shapes, including tubes of different length, wall thickness, and inner diameter (e.g., BASYC^{®} bacterial synthesized cellulose tubes). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 12, col 1; End: pg 12, col 1)The roughness of the BASYC^{®} tubes in the wet state resembles blood vessels and ranges between 7 and 14 nm.

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 15, col 1; End: pg 15, col 1)Enzymatic hydrolysis is milder than the more aggressive acid hydrolysis and yields whiskers that are relatively longer and more entangled, resulting in a hydrogel network that possesses much greater strength. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 15, col 1; End: pg 15, col 1)Cellulose nanocrystals take rodlike shapes with a typical width of a few nanometers and length of the order of hundreds of nanometers [50].

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 19, col 1; End: pg 19, col 1)Nanoscaled particles can be obtained from different cellulose esters, including commercially available cellulose acetates, cellulose acetate propionate, and cellulose acetate butyrate, and also from some organo-soluble cellulose ethers. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 19, col 1; End: pg 19, col 1)Methods commonly used are emulsiﬁcation solvent evaporation and the low-energy method of solvent displacement by dialysis, inducing nanoprecipitation [99]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 19, col 1; End: pg 19, col 1)Comparing the methods, a large amount of small and uniform nanoparticles can be obtained by the emulsiﬁcation solvent evaporation procedure, whereas solvent displacement yields narrowly distributed particles.

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 19, col 1; End: pg 19, col 1)16 [100]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 19, col 1; End: pg 19, col 1)Dialysis is easy to use and therefore appropriate for laboratory-scale studies.

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 19, col 1; End: pg 20, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 19, col 1; End: pg 19, col 1)It is important to point out that even spherical nanoparticles of polymers containing hydrophilic moieties such as 6-deoxy-6-(ω-aminoalkyl)aminocellulosecarbamates can be prepared. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 19, col 1; End: pg 19, col 1)Such nanoparticles are of particular interest because they possess primary amino groups that can be more easily modiﬁed than OH moieties. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 19, col 1; End: pg 20, col 1)Thus, labeling with rhodamine B isothiocyanate is simple and does not  change the size, stability, or shape of the nanoparticles. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 20, col 1; End: pg 20, col 1)Incorporation of such nanoparticles into human foreskin ﬁbroblasts BJ-1-htert and breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells could be successfully carried out without any transfection reagent [101].

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 20, col 1; End: pg 20, col 1)Although an organo-soluble cellulose derivative must be used for the technique of nanoprecipitation, even pure cellulose nanoparticles can be prepared. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 20, col 1; End: pg 20, col 1)Using trimethylsilyl cellulose (TMSC), the formation of nanoparticles by dialysis of the organic solvent against water is accompanied by complete removal of the TMS functions. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 20, col 1; End: pg 20, col 1)Analysis of particle size distribution shows that cellulose particles with a size of 80–260 nm are accessible in this simple manner [102]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 20, col 1; End: pg 20, col 1)Aqueous suspensions of the pure, spherical cellulose nanoparticles are storable for several months without any demixing.

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 21, col 1; End: pg 21, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 21, col 1; End: pg 21, col 1)As a result of the extended hydrogen bonds between the cellulose chains, special media and procedures must be applied to dissolve cellulose. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 21, col 1; End: pg 21, col 1)Today, solvents are divided into derivatizing solvents (forming covalent bonds of low stability with the polymer) and nonderivatizing solvents (interacting only physically with the polymer). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 21, col 1; End: pg 21, col 1)At the industrial scale, cellulose nitrate as a soluble and, thus, formable cellulose derivative can be used. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 21, col 1; End: pg 21, col 1)It should be pointed out that cellulose nitrate is a relatively stable cellulose derivative so introduction of ester moieties for “derivatizing dissolution” is somewhat questionable, although regeneration is easy to achieve. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 21, col 1; End: pg 21, col 1)The invention of a mixture of copper(II) hydroxide and aqueous ammonia for dissolving cellulose, with subsequent precipitation in dilute sulfuric acid, was followed by probably the most important large-scale technical process in ﬁber production, the viscose process. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 21, col 1; End: pg 21, col 1)Cellulose is transformed into cellulose xanthogenate, with subsequent spinning of the solution in aqueous sodium hydroxide. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 21, col 1; End: pg 21, col 1)The Lyocell process is an environmentally friendly alternative to the viscose process, whereby cellulose is dissolved physically in N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide monohydrate and regenerated in water [104]. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 21, col 1; End: pg 21, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 21, col 1; End: pg 21, col 1)The majority of cellulose solvents known today are only applied at the laboratory scale although there are some semitechnical trials being carried out for ﬁber spinning using novel solvents such as ionic liquids (ILs). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 21, col 1; End: pg 21, col 1)Until now there has been no homogeneous chemical modiﬁcation carried out at technical scales. 

NEW SECTION: 6.1 Polar Aprotic Solvents in Combination with Electrolytes  (Level: 2)


NEW PARA: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 22, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 22, col 1)Binary mixtures of organic liquids and inorganic or organic electrolytes are the most-used solvents for cellulose. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 22, col 1)Typical examples are N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone in combination with LiCl, and DMSO with tetra-n-butylammonium ﬂuoride^{(cid:3)} 3H_{2} O [105]. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 22, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 22, col 1)In these solvents, there are ions that can efﬁciently interact with hydrogen bonds and liquids that can solvate polar polymers such as cellulose. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 22, col 1)The essential factors required for dissolution of cellulose include:  1.  Solubility of a sufﬁcient amount of electrolyte in the organic liquid 2. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 22, col 1)Adequate stability of the electrolyte/solvent complex 3. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 22, col 1)Cooperative action of the solvated ion-pair on cellulose hydrogen bonds 4. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 22, col 1)Sufﬁcient basicity of the anion [106] 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 22, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 22, col 1)For example, to obtain a 3 wt% solution of cellulose in DMAc requires about 4 wt% LiCl, whereas 10 wt% LiCl is needed to dissolve it in DMF. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 22, col 1)This agrees with the fact that LiCl forms a stronger complex with the former solvent [107]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 22, col 1)By contrast, NaCl is not appropriate because it is insoluble in DMAc and DMF. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 22, col 1)The strength of cation–solvent association of alkali metal chlorides in DMAc and DMF is in the order Li^{+} >_{Na}^{+} >_{K}^{+} >_{Cs}^{+} (as determined by electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 22, col 1)For LiCl, the strength of cation–solvent association is in the order N,N-dimethylpropionamide^{>} DMAc^{(cid:6)} DMF. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 22, col 1)That is, the association increases as a function of increasing negative charge on the oxygen atom of the C¼O group of the solvent [108, 109]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 22, col 1)For DMAc, LiCl is more efﬁcient than LiBr for dissolving cellulose, because the later halide ion is less basic than the former. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 22, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 22, col 1)In general, to design new solvents of this type, the requirements mentioned must be fulﬁlled. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 22, col 1)Thus, it was found that quaternary tetraalkylammonium chlorides with one long alkyl chain dissolve in various organic solvents and constitute a new class of cellulose solvents. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 22, col 1)In contrast to the well-established solvent DMAc/LiCl, cellulose dissolves in DMA/quaternary ammonium chlorides without any pretreatment (Fig. 18). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 22, col 1)Consequently, use of the new solvent avoids some of the disadvantages of DMAc/LiCl [110]. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 23, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 22, col 1)Highly surprising is the ﬁnding that cellulose dissolves quickly even in a mixture of acetone/triethyloctylammonium chloride containing 9 parts of the salt and 20 parts of the organic liquid. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 22, col 1)No pretreatment or activation of the cellulose is necessary. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 22, col 1)This has not yet been reported for binary acetone/salt mixtures, including ILs, where acetone has been found to cause immediate cellulose precipitation [111]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 22, col 1)Further increase in the amount of triethyloctylammonium chloride does not have an adverse effect on the solution. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 22, col 1)The^{13} C-NMR spectrum measured for cellulose dissolved in acetone/triethyloctylammonium chloride veriﬁes that the biopolymer is dissolved without being chemically modiﬁed (nonderivatizing solvent) as is the case for all solvents of this class (Fig. 19). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 22, col 1; End: pg 23, col 1)Nevertheless, the solvent LiCl/DMAc is still the most extensively employed because it is capable of  dissolving different celluloses, including samples of high DP and index of crystallinity (e.g., cotton linters and even bacterial cellulose). 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 23, col 1; End: pg 24, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 23, col 1; End: pg 23, col 1)The combination of DMSO and tetra-n-butyl ammonium ﬂuoride^{(cid:3)} 3H_{2} O (TBAF^{(cid:3)} 3H_{2} O, premixed) dissolves cellulose very efﬁciently without any pretreatment as a result of the fact that the ﬂuoride ion is a harder base than the chloride ion (LiCl/DMAc). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 23, col 1; End: pg 24, col 1)Furthermore, the cation is voluminous and hence acts as  a “spacer,” preventing re-attachment [105, 112]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 24, col 1; End: pg 24, col 1)For instance, clear solutions of microcrystalline cellulose were obtained in 15 min at room temperature, whereas ﬁbrous sisal required 30 min at room temperature plus 60 min at 60^{(cid:4)} C [113]. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 24, col 1; End: pg 24, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 24, col 1; End: pg 24, col 1)The commercially available, stable TBAF contains 3 mole of water. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 24, col 1; End: pg 24, col 1)The water may inﬂuence the chemical modiﬁcation of dissolved cellulose because of hydrolysis of the reagent. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 24, col 1; End: pg 24, col 1)However, the cellulose solution can be partially dehydrated by distilling off about 30% of the solvent before addition of the reagent (e.g., acetic anhydride). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 24, col 1; End: pg 24, col 1)The esteriﬁcation yields products of higher degree of substitution (DS) [113]. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 24, col 1; End: pg 24, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 24, col 1; End: pg 24, col 1)Complete dehydration of TBAF^{(cid:3)} 3H_{2} O, resulting in the water-free salt, is impossible because anhydrous TBAF is unstable and undergoes rapid E2 elimination, resulting in the formation of hydrogen diﬂuoride anions [114]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 24, col 1; End: pg 24, col 1)However, preparation of anhydrous TBAF in situ by reacting tetra-n-butylammonium cyanide with hexaﬂuorobenzene in dry DMSO has been described [115]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 24, col 1; End: pg 24, col 1)Freshly prepared water-free DMSO/TBAF solution, even in the presence of the by-product hexacyanobenzene, dissolves cellulose very easily. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 24, col 1; End: pg 24, col 1)In the water-free solvent, dissolution of bleached cotton ﬁbers with very high DP of 3,743 occurs within a short time, as visualized by optical microscopy (Fig. 20, [116]). 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 24, col 1; End: pg 25, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 24, col 1; End: pg 24, col 1)Other ammonium salts have been studied as electrolytes in DMSO-based cellulose solvents, namely tetramethylammonium ﬂuoride (TMAF) and benzyltrimethylammonium ﬂuoride monohydrate (BTMAF^{(cid:3)} H_{2} O). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 24, col 1; End: pg 25, col 1)At room temperature, 0.94 mol/L TBAF^{(cid:3)} 3H_{2} O could be dissolved in DMSO, but only 0.025 mol/L of  BTMAF^{(cid:3)} H_{2} O dissolves at room temperature, and 0.142 mol/L at 90^{(cid:4)} C. TMAF is insoluble in DMSO. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 25, col 1; End: pg 25, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 25, col 1; End: pg 25, col 1)Up to 1 wt% of cellulose is soluble in DMSO/BTMAF^{(cid:3)} H_{2} O by heating the system to 85^{(cid:4)} C to maintain an adequate ﬂuoride ion concentration. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 25, col 1; End: pg 25, col 1)A minimal amount of 2.2 ﬂuoride ions per AGU is needed. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 25, col 1; End: pg 25, col 1)In the case of TBAF^{(cid:3)} 3H_{2} O, the relation between the ﬂuoride ions and AGU depends on the DP of the cellulose (as also known for DMAc/LiCl). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 25, col 1; End: pg 25, col 1)Thus, for microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel, DP 332) a ratio of 1:1 (salt/cellulose) is appropriate, whereas for spruce sulﬁte pulp (DP 600) and cotton linters (DP 1,198) a ratio of 3:1 is needed. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 25, col 1; End: pg 25, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 25, col 1; End: pg 25, col 1)These results again substantiate the simple approach mentioned above for creation of new solvents for cellulose. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 25, col 1; End: pg 25, col 1)Following such an approach, another solvent was found very recently; almost anhydrous dibenzyldimethylammonium (BMAF^{(cid:3)} 0.1H_{2} O) in DMSO dissolves microcrystalline and ﬁbrous celluloses [117]. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 25, col 1; End: pg 26, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 25, col 1; End: pg 25, col 1)It should be pointed out that clear cellulose solutions are not necessarily molecularly dispersed, but may contain aggregates of still-ordered cellulose molecules [118]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 25, col 1; End: pg 25, col 1)These aggregates were described as forming a “fringed” micellar structure (Fig. 21a) composed of laterally aligned chains, forming a rather compact and possibly geometrically anisotropic core that is immiscible in the solvent. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 25, col 1; End: pg 25, col 1)The solvated amorphous cellulose chains form “coronas” at both ends of the particles [119]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 25, col 1; End: pg 25, col 1)The thickness of the coronas and the number of molecular chains forming the aggregate increase as a function of both cellulose concentration and the interfacial tension between the solvent and particle core [120]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 25, col 1; End: pg 25, col 1)Monodisperse solutions of cellulose molecules with small (Fig. 21b), and large (Fig. 21c) DP produced typical features. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 25, col 1; End: pg 25, col 1)The length of the short cellulose chain is practically equal to its persistent length, (i.e., there is neither chain coiling nor interaction with other chains). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 25, col 1; End: pg 26, col 1)The ﬂexibility of the long chain polymer allows the formation of strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds, provided that the OH groups reside for some time within a “critical  distance” of each other (ca. 0.3 nm), sufﬁcient for van der Waals forces to operate (Fig. 21c) [121]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 26, col 1; End: pg 26, col 1)As a result, the properties of cellulose (DP, crystallinity, and concentration) affect its solution state and, hence, its derivatization. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 26, col 1; End: pg 26, col 1)For the same cellulose, the accessibility of the OH groups increases with decreasing solution concentration. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 26, col 1; End: pg 26, col 1)For different celluloses, at a given concentration, only the outer surface of the fringed micellar core is accessible and the area of this part decreases with DP and crystallinity. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 26, col 1; End: pg 26, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 26, col 1; End: pg 26, col 1)Regarding chemical modiﬁcation, molecularly dispersed solutions are not needed. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 26, col 1; End: pg 26, col 1)Moreover, as a result of the change in structure of the cellulose derivative compared with the starting material, and considering the DS, the different structures formed during the course of reaction have different interactions with the solvent components. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 26, col 1; End: pg 26, col 1)In some cases the reaction systems can become microheterogeneous, and possibly even complete gelation or precipitation can occur.

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 26, col 1; End: pg 26, col 1)The ﬁrst ionic liquids (ILs) used for esteriﬁcation of cellulose were Nalkylpyridinium halides, especially N-ethylpyridinium chloride (EPyCl) and Nbenzylpyridinium chloride (BPyCl) [122]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 26, col 1; End: pg 26, col 1)Nevertheless, the most promising ILs for the modiﬁcation of cellulose are the salts of 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 26, col 1; End: pg 26, col 1)In 2002, it was shown that such ILs could open new paths for the shaping of polysaccharides [123, 124]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 26, col 1; End: pg 26, col 1)Additionally, they could lead to commercially relevant routes toward homogeneous cellulose chemistry, which would signiﬁcantly broaden the number of tailored cellulose derivatives.

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 26, col 1; End: pg 26, col 1)Nevertheless, according to the literature [126, 127] and our own experience, cellulose can be dissolved in ILs with imidazolium, ammonium, and pyridinium.

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 30, col 1; End: pg 30, col 1)In the case of acetylation, the cellulose acetate formed may dissolve during the course of reaction, thus it is not considered a homogeneous reaction.

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 30, col 1; End: pg 30, col 1)In the case of derivatizing solvents, both conversion of the soluble intermediate formed during dissolution and modiﬁcation of the isolated intermediate (which is re-dissolved in an organic solvent such as DMSO or DMF) are considered homogeneous reactions.

NEW SECTION: 7.1 Homogeneous Modiﬁcation of Cellulose 7.1.1 Acylation of Cellulose  (Level: 2)


NEW PARA: (Start: pg 30, col 1; End: pg 31, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 30, col 1; End: pg 30, col 1)Although a wide variety of solvents for cellulose have been developed and investigated in recent years, only a few have shown the potential for controlled and homogeneous functionalization of the polysaccharide (Table 1) [157]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 30, col 1; End: pg 30, col 1)Limitations to the application of solvents result from high toxicity, high reactivity of the solvents leading to undesired side reactions, and loss of solubility during reactions. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 30, col 1; End: pg 31, col 1)The latter results in inhomogeneous mixtures through formation of gels and pastes,  which are difﬁcult to mix, and even through formation of de-swollen particles of low reactivity, which settle out in the reaction medium. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 31, col 1; End: pg 31, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 31, col 1; End: pg 31, col 1)Homogeneous reaction conditions give the opportunity for esteriﬁcation with state of the art reagents, for example, after in situ activation of carboxylic acids, which is characterized by reacting the carboxylic acid with a reagent to form an intermediate, highly reactive carboxylic acid derivative. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 31, col 1; End: pg 31, col 1)The carboxylic acid derivative can be formed prior to reaction with the polysaccharide or converted directly in a one-pot reaction. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 31, col 1; End: pg 31, col 1)Modiﬁcation of cellulose with carboxylic acids after in situ activation has made a broad variety of new esters accessible, because common reactive derivatives such as anhydrides or chlorides are not accessible for numerous acids (e.g., unsaturated or hydrolytically instable acids). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 31, col 1; End: pg 31, col 1)The mild reaction conditions applied for in situ activation avoids side reactions such as pericyclic reactions, hydrolysis, and oxidation [158]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 31, col 1; End: pg 31, col 1)For example, a reaction with enormous potential for cellulose modiﬁcation is the homogeneous one-pot reaction after in situ activation of carboxylic acids with N,N^{0} -carbonyldiimidazole (CDI), which has been well known in bioorganic chemistry since 1962 [159]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 31, col 1; End: pg 31, col 1)The reactive imidazolide of the acid is generated, and the by-products CO_{2} and imidazole are nontoxic (Fig. 26). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 31, col 1; End: pg 31, col 1)The pH is almost constant during the conversion, resulting in negligible chain degradation. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 31, col 1; End: pg 31, col 1)In comparison to dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), the application of CDI is much more efﬁcient, avoids most of the side reactions, and allows the use of DMSO (a good solvent for most complex carboxylic acids). 

NEW SECTION: 7.1.2 Sulfation of Cellulose  (Level: 3)


NEW PARA: (Start: pg 31, col 1; End: pg 31, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 31, col 1; End: pg 31, col 1)Although studied for decades, sulfation of cellulose is still of interest because the products show pronounced bioactivity and can be used for self-assembly systems such as polyelectrolyte complexes. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 31, col 1; End: pg 31, col 1)A very elegant method offers the sulfation of cellulose dissolved in ILs. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 31, col 1; End: pg 31, col 1)Cellulose dissolved in BMIMCl/co-solvent mixtures can be easily converted into cellulose sulfate (CS) by using SO_{3} -Py, SO_{3} -DMF, or ClSO_{3} H [160]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 31, col 1; End: pg 31, col 1)Highly substituted CS with DS values up to 3 has been reported for sulfation in BMIMCl at 30^{(cid:4)} C [161]; however, it should be noted that cellulose/IL solutions slowly turned solid upon cooling to room temperature, depending on the cellulose and moisture content. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 31, col 1; End: pg 31, col 1)Synthesis of CS with an even distribution of sulfate groups along the polymer chains requires a dipolar aprotic co-solvent that drastically reduces the solution viscosity and does not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the reactivity of the sulfating agent [162]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 31, col 1; End: pg 31, col 1)At a 2:1 molar ratio of SO_{3} -DMF/AGU, the sulfation of microcrystalline cellulose in BMIMCl and BMIMCl/DMF mixtures leads to comparable DS values of about 0.86. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 31, col 1; End: pg 31, col 1)Whereas CS synthesized without co-solvent is insoluble, the other readily dissolves in water. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 31, col 1; End: pg 32, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 31, col 1; End: pg 31, col 1)Homogeneous sulfation of cellulose in IL allows tuning of CS properties simply by adjusting the amount of sulfating agent and choosing different types of cellulose. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 31, col 1; End: pg 31, col 1)If conducted at room temperature, the reaction leads only to minor polymer degradation. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 31, col 1; End: pg 31, col 1)This makes the procedure valuable for the preparation of watersoluble CS over a wide DS range. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 31, col 1; End: pg 32, col 1)In particular, capsules of CS with low DS can  be prepared efﬁciently in IL/co-solvent mixtures and are of interest for bioencapsulation applications [162].

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 32, col 1; End: pg 32, col 1)In addition to typical modiﬁcation of the hydroxyl groups of cellulose, chemical modiﬁcation can be carried out by reaction at the C atoms of the AGU. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 32, col 1; End: pg 33, col 1)Nucleophilic displacement (S_{N} ) reactions with cellulose are based on the transformation of  hydroxyl groups of the biopolymer to a good leaving group, mainly by tosylation [163, 164]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 33, col 1; End: pg 33, col 1)A broad variety of cellulose derivatives are accessible, as summarized in Table 2. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 33, col 1; End: pg 33, col 1)The S_{N} reaction occurs almost exclusively at the primary position of the repeating unit, most probably for steric reasons. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 33, col 1; End: pg 33, col 1)The S_{N} of a tosylate moiety occurs via a S_{N} 2 mechanism (i.e., a transition state appears containing ﬁve atoms that is hardly formed at the secondary positions of the modiﬁed AGU).

Lower: Sedimentation coefﬁcient distribution for AEA cellulose at different concentrations: 2.0 (black), 1.0 (red), 0.75 (blue), 0.25 (green), and 0.125 mg/mL (pink). Based on the s~M^{2/3} scaling relationship, the supermonomers associate into supertrimers, superhexamers, and super-9-mers. There is also evidence for some superdimers, although they were not evident at the highest loading concentration. The proportion of supermonomers drops relative to the higher-order species indicates partial reversibility, even with the higher-order association
