	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 17; End: pg 6, col 17)Ionic liquids Casting IL/cellulose dispersions  celluloses have been synthesized in MWCNT-dispersed medium and it was found that a substantial number of MWCNTs were attached to the surfaces of the bacterial cellulose brils.^{59}  Recently, we have fabricated a BC–polyaniline (PANI) composite. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 6, col 1; End: pg 6, col 1)PANI was polymerized and deposited as an adhering layer on the surfaces of the cellulose bers. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 6, col 1; End: pg 6, col 1)This forms a relatively uniform thin-lm conductive material, and its electrical conductivity can reach 10^{(cid:1)1} S cm^{(cid:1)1} . 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 6, col 1; End: pg 6, col 1)By varying the reaction time and controlling the proton acid doping/dedoping it is possible to obtain materials having a range of conductivities.^{47} BC can also be combined with polyaniline^{60,61} and polypyrrole,^{62} which can be polymerized through chemical or electrochemical polymerization. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 6, col 1; End: pg 6, col 2)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 6, col 1; End: pg 6, col 1)Metal nanoparticles (such as Au, Ag) have also been applied as the lm forming material to produce various types of lms (including BC) because of their good biocompatibility and conductivity. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 6, col 1; End: pg 6, col 1)Silver metal and its compounds have strong inhibitory and bactericidal eﬀects as well as a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activities. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 6, col 1; End: pg 6, col 2)As a result there have been many investigations of silver combined with BC for antimicrobial applications.^{63–65}  Medical applications of bacterial cellulose electroconductive hydrogels  Bacterial cellulose is a natural hydrogel, with a stable nanober network, high water content, shape-ability during biosynthesis,  and biocompatibility.^{66} Such nanobers are neither cytotoxic nor genotoxic. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 6, col 2; End: pg 6, col 2)BC is also a 3D template for in vitro and in vivo tissue growth, which can be used for medical implants ranging from bone and cartilage repair to tubular prototype gras for  vascular surgery.^{67}  Electroconductive hydrogels provide good small molecule transport, high hydration levels and biocompatibility. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 6, col 2; End: pg 6, col 2)Crosslinked hydrogels can then provide redox switching and electrical properties of inherently conductive polymers. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 6, col 2; End: pg 6, col 2)When based on bacterial cellulose these have three-dimensional polymeric networks, imbibe large amounts of water, and are exible with good mechanical properties. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 6, col 2; End: pg 6, col 2)They can change their size and shape in response to environmental stimuli.^{Cellulose–} SWNT composites have proved to be homogenous, hydrophilic, conductive and biocompatible, and have been used to immobilize leukemia K562 cells on a gold electrode in a cell impedance sensor.^{30} Using BC hydrogels as natural biotemplates, mesoporous titania networks consisting of interconnected anatase nanowires have been synthesized. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 6, col 2; End: pg 6, col 2)These BC–TiO_{2} hydrogels may nd potential applications in areas including photocatalysis, photovoltaics, and bone-tissue engineering.^{68} Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and BC nanocomposites have been used for the immobilization of heme proteins. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 6, col 2; End: pg 6, col 2)Horseradish peroxidase (HRP), hemoglobin (Hb) and myoglobin (Mb) immobilized in a Au–BC lm showed high biocatalytic activity with good sensitivity, low detection limit and fast response toward hydrogen peroxide.^{69}

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 7, col 1; End: pg 7, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 7, col 1; End: pg 7, col 1)electronic properties.^{70} Legnani et al.^{71} used BC as the exible substrate for the fabrication of organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 7, col 1; End: pg 7, col 1)Indium tin oxide (ITO) thin lms were deposited onto the membrane at room temperature using radio frequency magnetron sputtering. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 7, col 1; End: pg 7, col 1)The average transmittance of BC membrane substrates at 550 nm is only 40%. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 7, col 1; End: pg 7, col 1)Clarity is the most important property for bottom emissive displays, and a total light transmission of >85% over 400–800 nm coupled with a haze of less than 0.7% are typical of what is required.^{72} Thus many groups have made eﬀorts to improve the light transmittance of BC.^{73} Nogi et al.^{74} fabricated transparent composites with bacterial cellulose (BC) nanobers which have low thermal expansion, and even an electroluminescent layer could be deposited onto these transparent BC nanocomposites. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 7, col 1; End: pg 7, col 1)However, this nal nanocomposite material is not exible enough and therefore cannot achieve the bending radius required for roll-to-roll processing.

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 7, col 1; End: pg 7, col 1)Cellulose-based electro-active paper is light in weight, is biodegradable, and has a large displacement output and low actuation voltage when dry.^{75} Jeon et al.  developed such an electro-active biopolymer actuator based on bacterial cellulose. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 7, col 1; End: pg 7, col 1)They showed that the LiCl treated bacterial cellulose can be adjusted to achieve a better actuation performance by controlling the crystallinity and stiﬀness of the pristine BC.^{76} Piezoelectric materials are smart materials which can convert mechanical energy (such as from breathing, or walking) into more useful electrical energy. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 7, col 1; End: pg 7, col 1)However, traditional piezoelectrics are hard, inexible crystals which can also be toxic. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 7, col 1; End: pg 7, col 1)BCbased piezoelectric materials could lead to nanopiezoelectric devices that combine the key qualities of exibility, energy eﬃciency, and biocompatibility.

Cellulose-based electroconductive composites can be prepared by combining conducting electroactive materials with hydrophilic biocompatible cellulose. Inorganic nanoparticles, such as metal ions and oxides, carbon nanotubes, graphene and graphene oxide, conducting polymers, and ionic liquids (through doping, blending or coating) can be introduced into the cellulose matrix. Such composites can form a biocompatible interface for microelectronic devices, and provide a biocompatible matrix or composites are described and future applications are considered. a Department of Biomedical Engineering, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430074, P.
