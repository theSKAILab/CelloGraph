NEW SECTION: Abstract This paper provides a review of the scientiﬁc literature concerned with adhesion and surface properties of cellulose and nanocellulose. Cellulose is the most abundant chemical compound on earth and its natural afﬁnity for self-adhesion has long been recognized. The ease of adhesion that occurs in cellulose has contributed to its use in paper and other ﬁber-based composite materials. Cellulose adhesion, which has received considerable attention over the past half century, occurs over a practical length scale ranging from the nanoscale to millimeters. Adhesion theories that have been examined in the bonding of cellulose ﬁbers include: mechanical interlocking, adsorption or wetting theory, diffusion theory, and the theory of weak boundary layers. Cellulose ﬁbers on the nanoscale are prepared in four different ways: (1) bacterial cellulose nanoﬁbers, (2) cellulose nanoﬁbers by electrospinning, (3) microﬁbrillated cellulose plant cell ﬁbers and (4) nanorods or cellulose whiskers. Structure and properties of nanocellulose that are important include: morphology, crystalline structure, surface properties, chemical and physical properties, and properties in liquid suspension. Cellulosic nanoﬁbers present a very high surface area which makes the adhesion properties the most important parameter to control for nanocomposite applications. In this paper, we will focus on discussion of the adhesion and surface characteristics of cellulose nanoﬁbers that impact its properties and application in nanomaterials.  (Level: 1)

|research across all segments of science and engineering since the enactment of the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) in 2001. Nanomaterials derived from renewable biomaterials, especially cellulose and lignocellulose, will undoubtedly play a large role in the nanotechnology research effort. To exploit their poten- tial, R&D investments must be made in the science and engineering that will fully determine the properties and characteristics of cellulose and lignocellulose at the nanoscale, develop the technologies to manipulate self-assembly and multifunction- allity, and develop these new technologies to the point where industry can produce advanced and cost-competitive cellulose and lignocellulose-based products [1]. The behavior of cellulose surfaces in different media as well as their interac- tion with different chemicals is of great importance in their current and future applications (papermaking, composites and nanocomposites). The mechanical per- formance of composites, for instance, is dependent on the degree of dispersion of the ﬁbers in the matrix polymer and the nature and intensity of ﬁber–polymer ad- hesion interactions. To explain cellulose adhesion phenomena, it is important to review the mechanisms of adhesion. Several theories have been proposed to pro- vide an explanation for adhesion phenomena; however, there is no single theory that explains adhesion in a general, comprehensive way. The bonding phenomenon is the sum of a number of mechanical, physical and chemical forces that overlap and inﬂuence each other. Based on this, it is not possible to separate these forces, and adhesion has been characterized as related to mechanical interlocking caused by the mechanical anchoring of the adhesive in the pores and the uneven parts of the surface; electrostatic forces, as they relate to the difference in electoneg- ativities of adhering materials; diffusion which is related to the interpenetration of molecular chains at the interface where the adhesive and surface being bonded interact; weak boundary layers referring to the accumulation of air bubbles or low- molecular-weight compounds from the adhesive, the adherends or the surroundings at the interface; and adsorption and wetting which are related to highly localized intermolecular forces. Wetting may be attributed to acid–base interactions, weak hydrogen bonding or van der Waals forces (dipole–dipole and dispersion forces). The extent of wetting depends on the differences in surface free energies of the solid, liquid and subsequent interface.

|both crystalline and amorphous regions. Both linear cellulose molecules and the supermolecular microﬁbrils have a dominant inﬂuence on the behavior of wood as a material. A number of structures for the microﬁbril have been proposed. These models differ primarily in the description of the amorphous or less ordered regions. All the models can be reduced to one of three basic structures [3, 4]. 1. “Longitudinally arranged molecules change from one ordered region to the sub- sequent one, the transition areas being less ordered regions (fringed micelle system)”. 2. “The ﬁbrilllar units are individual cords consisting of longitudinally arranged molecules and sequences of ordered and disordered regions”. 3. “The ordered regions are packages of chains folded in a longitudinal direction, the areas containing the turns between adjacent chain packages being the less ordered regions”. The molecular aggregations of cellulose in the wood cell wall contribute to its unique polymer properties. For improving the interaction or interfacial adhesion of cellulose with hydrophobic materials (solvents) it is possible to add a surfactant or to chemically modify its surface. The cellulose reactivity or the lack of reac- tivity depends on its structure. To modify cellulose structure, the highly ordered hydrogen-bonded lattice must be disrupted by swelling or dissolution. The reactive sites on cellulose, which may be derivatized, are the three-hydroxyl groups indi- cated as C-2, C-3 and C-6 (Fig. 1). C-6 is a primary hydroxyl, which is the most reactive position for esteriﬁcation reactions while C-2 is the more acidic of the two secondary hydroxyl groups and is the more reactive site for etheriﬁcation. Cellulose has a strong afﬁnity to itself and hydroxyl containing materials. Based on the preponderance of hydroxyl functional groups, cellulose is very reactive with water. At common ambient environmental conditions, cellulose will have at least a monomolecular layer and up to several molecular layers of water associated with it [5]. Cellulose is very stable in a variety of solvents and can only be dissolved by the application of strong acids or strong hydrogen bonding solvent systems, usually amine-based. The thermal properties of cellulose are such that the cellulose glass transition temperature is in the range of 200 to 230^{◦} C [6], which is close to its thermal decomposition temperature of 260^{◦} C.

|3. Cellulose Adhesion in Paper Adhesion in cellulose-based ﬁber materials, i.e. paper, has long been recognized going back 5000 years when Egyptians invented papyrus parchments [7]. The ease of adhesion that occurs between cellulose ﬁbers has contributed to a globally im- portant industry that is among the largest in the world. Cellulose ﬁber bonding in paper and related products occurs over a practical length scale ranging from the nanoscale to millimeters, and this topic has received considerable attention over the past 50 years [8]. The adhesion theories that have been examined in the bonding of cellulose ﬁbers in paper include: mechanical interlocking, adsorption or wetting theory, diffusion theory, and the theory of weak boundary layers. Most paper ﬁbers manufactured from wood pulp range in length from 1 to 7 mm depending on the species [7]. The bonding of cellulose ﬁbers in paper relies primarily on hydrogen bonding between the ﬁbers that occurs as the wetted ﬁbers dry in contact with each other, and the bond strength can vary greatly depending on the method(s) used to prepare the ﬁbers including the pulping, bleaching and/or reﬁning process. Hydro- gen bonding between ﬁbers requires close proximity between adjacent hydroxyl groups (0.25–0.35 nm). The partial solubility of cellulose in water and the diffusion theory of adhesion have also been reported since reﬁned ﬁbers have a ﬁbrillar struc- ture on the near-molecular-size scale that contributes to adhesion [8]. Mechanical interlocking has not been shown to be important in the bonding of cellulose ﬁbers in paper except for paper in the bone-dry condition [8]. The adsorption of hydropho- bic materials on cellulose ﬁbers during papermaking greatly decreases ﬁber-to-ﬁber bonding and is related to the weak boundary layer theory of adhesion [9].

|electrolyte solution was dominated by double layer repulsive forces, with the range and magnitude of net force depending on electrolyte concentration. The interaction was attributed to the negative charge of the cellulose surface. 4.2. Adsorption or Wettability Surface energy or surface wettability as an indication of the adhesion properties of cellulose has been widely studied using techniques that include thin-layer wicking [19], liquid absorption into cellulose pulp sheets [20], powder contact angle analy- sis [21], contact angle analysis of cellulose ﬁlms [22, 23], the Whilhelmy technique [24], inverse gas chromatography [25–27] and atomic force microscopy [16, 17, 28]. For surface energy determinations, the results are mainly interpreted in terms of Lifshitz–van der Waals (γ^{LW}_{s}^{)} and electron-donor (base, γ^{−} s^{),} and electron-acceptor (acid, γ^{+} s^{)} components of the surface energy. Table 1(a)–(c) show the surface energy components of cellulose presented by different authors. Table 1(a)–(c) in- dicate that in some cases cellulose surfaces have a lower acid–base component compared to the dispersion component; conversely in other cases cellulose sur- faces have a higher acid–base component. The variation in the values obtained could be explained principally because of the speciﬁc raw material used (prepa- ration), the surface morphology, the techniques used for the measurements, and in some cases to the relationship of the models used for the calculations of the sur- face energy. Mota et al. [19] determined the surface energy components of three

Microﬁbrillated Cellulose Microﬁbrillated cellulose (MFC) is a material derived by disintegrating digested cellulose through a homogenizing process, exposing the underlying microﬁbrils. This new morphology was developed by Turbak et al. [53] in the early 1980s. This process usually starts with wood pulp; however, Dufresne et al. [54], describe how microﬁbrillated cellulose can be extracted from sugar beets. Regardless of the start- ing material, the process always involves a homogenization process. Nakagaito and Yano [55] describe the homogenizing process as subjecting the cellulose to a recip- rocating motion producing a high pressure drop resulting in shearing and impact forces. The shearing and impact forces are responsible for exposing the substruc- tural cellulose microﬁbrils. Through the homogenization process, the cellulose bundles are split and de- graded leaving microﬁbrillated cellulose strands with dimensions of 10–100 nm [30]. Elementary kraft ﬁbers are on the order of 10’s of µm’s wide and are rod like [55]; whereas MFC is a network of interconnected microﬁbrils with little order on the nanometer scale, Fig. 4. Through the homogenization process the ratio of surface area to volume for the ﬁbers is increased dramatically. Nakagaito and Yano [56] researched phenolic resin reinforced composites where the composite mats had varying resin content. The MFC was passed through a high

|worked with both microﬁbrils of cellulose and cellulose whiskers to compare the reinforcement properties for these two types of cellulose. Cellulose was exposed to sulfuric acid baths at 40^{◦} C for 35 minutes. Two sulfuric acid baths were used: one at 20 wt% and one at 60 wt%. The polymer used was latex reinforced with 6 wt% ﬁber either untreated or treated in one of the sulfuric acid baths. Results from the study showed that the tensile strength and tensile modulus increased when the cellulosic ﬁbers were added; however, the highest values were found for the microﬁbril cellulose with no acid treatments. The elongation at break decreased for the material when the cellulosic ﬁbers were added and this is hypothesized to be due to the entanglement of the cellulosic ﬁbers. For the reinforced material, the elongation at break increased as a function of acid hydrolysis strength. All of this is an indication of the signiﬁcance of entanglement in the overall macroscopic physical properties of the cellulosic reinforced composites. The hydrogen bonding that takes place between the nanocellulosic materials is well known but the study mentioned above demonstrates how important entangle- ments are for the microﬁbrillated cellulosic materials. 5.4. Cellulose Nanorods or Whiskers of Cellulose Whiskers of cellulose, the needle-like structure of the cellulose crystallite, have been mainly studied for their liquid crystalline behavior in concentrated aqueous suspensions [65, 67–69] and for their reinforcing effect when added to a poly- meric matrix giving rise to very strong and tough percolating networks of hydrogen bonded whiskers [70–76]. Whiskers of cellulose are renewable materials which pos- sess high availability, light weight and high mechanical properties. They consist of slender parallelepiped rods and, depending on their origin, the lateral dimensions range from about 2–50 nm in diameter for length than can reach several tens of micrometers [77]. According to these dimensions, they possess high aspect ratios and high speciﬁc surface area of about 150 m^{2} /g [78]. See an example of whiskers of cellulose in Fig. 5 [104].

|alternative and ensures a good dispersion level of the ﬁller required for homoge- neous composite processing [79, 98]. The simplest technique to process a composite material from latex and aqueous suspension of whiskers consists in mixing and casting the two aqueous suspensions. A solid nanocomposite ﬁlm can be then ob- tained by water evaporation and particle coalescence at a temperature higher than the glass transition temperature of the matrix [77]. Some polymer latexes used for ﬁlm nanocomposites include those obtained by copolymerization of styrene and butyl acrylate [77, 79, 101] and poly(hydroxyoctanoate). Another alternative to processing nanocomposites using whiskers consists in dispersing them in an or- ganic medium. In this case, for improving compatibility between the polar whiskers and apolar matrices, the addition of surfactants and chemical modiﬁcation of the whiskers have been proposed [80, 81, 86]. Surface modiﬁcation involves reacting the hydroxyl groups on the surface of whiskers and in this way Grunert and Win- ter [62], for instance, used trimethylsilylation for reducing the hydrophilicity of the whisker surfaces. The use of surfactants improves compatibility, but large amounts of them are required because of the high speciﬁc area of the whiskers [76]. Disper- sion of cellulose whiskers has also been studied using polar organic solvents [79, 102]. Dufresne et al. [79] dispersed cellulose whiskers from tunicin in an organic solvent (N,N-dimethylformamide, DMF) without addition of a surfactant or any chemical modiﬁcation. Gray et al. [102] dispersed whiskers of cellulose in DMF and in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and prepared nanocomposite ﬁlms. Cavaillé et al. [72] processed and characterized thermosetting nanocomposites using aqueous suspensions of microcrystalline cellulose and an epoxy matrix. They concluded that the reinforcing effect was due to the strong interactions existing between the cel- lulose whiskers and the epoxy network and the creation of a percolating network linked by H-bonds between cellulose ﬁbers. 5.4.1. Adhesion Whiskers of cellulose have a hydroxyl-rich surface and in contact with relatively polar surfaces (like ester functional groups present in PVAc) will form hydrogen bonds that are expected to strengthen the interface signiﬁcantly with a positive im- pact on the mechanical properties of the material. It has been previously shown that the cellulose whiskers form a rigid three-dimensional network above whisker per- colation because of hydrogen bond formation between the individual whiskers [93]. Some chemical modiﬁcations of the surface of cellulose whiskers that increase its hydrophobicity include surface acylation [96] and silylation [61, 65]. Such modiﬁ- cation allows the whiskers to disperse in solvents of low polarity. A summary with the main properties of nanocellulose prepared by different processes is presented in Table 3.

|Most of the research has been focused on the preparation of cellulose whiskers (using different sources), characterization and their incorporation in thermoplastic, thermosetting and/or biodegradable matrices (PLA) for nanocomposite production. However, applications of cellulose whisker nanocomposites have not achieved com- mercial viability. The traditional way to obtain cellulose whiskers is through a hydrolysis process which has been optimized from 2–3% yield to 30% yield (of initial weight). The interface between the polymer matrix and whiskers of cellulose and the dispersion quality of the nanocellulose in polymer matrices still need to be optimized for better interactions and improvement of the mechanical properties of the ﬁnal nanocomposites.
