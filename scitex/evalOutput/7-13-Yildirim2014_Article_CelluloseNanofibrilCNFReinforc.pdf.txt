	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)The comparison of thermal insulation properties (Table 5) showed that the thermal conductivity and thermal resistivity results for the foams produced in this study appear promising like the compression properties. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 2)Foams produced in this study have 3–4 times better thermal resistivity properties when compared to gypsum board that has 0.83 (cid:3)F.h.ft^{2} /BTU R-value (thermal resistivity) for 25.4 mm thickness (Gypsum Association 2010) and the foams have similar thermal conductivity with nanoporous silica aerogel impregnated highly porous zirconia ceramics  have thermal conductivity from 0.041 W/m-K to 0.098 W/m-K (Hong et al. 2013). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 2; End: pg 9, col 2)Mahlia et al.  showed that, thermal conductivities of some insulation materials as follows: ﬁberglass-urethane 0.021 W/m-K, ﬁberglass-rigid 0.33 W/m-K, urethane-rigid 0.024 W/ m-K, perlite 0.054 W/m-K, extruded polystyrene 0.029 W/m–K and the urethane (roof deck) 0.021 W/m–K (Mahlia et al. 2007). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 2; End: pg 9, col 2)Hsu and Heldman showed that, granular starch has 0.49 W/m–K thermal conductivity and gelatinized starch have 0.47 W/m-K thermal conductivity (Hsu and Heldman 2004), which are so conductive when compared the CNF reinforced starch foams produced in this study. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 2; End: pg 10, col 2)Glenn and Irving  showed that, corn freeze-dried starch has a 0.040 W/  m-K thermal conductivity (Glenn and Irving 1995a), which is almost same when compared to our study due to similar production method and cellular structure of materials. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 10, col 1; End: pg 10, col 2)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 10, col 1; End: pg 10, col 1)As a result of thermal analyses (Table 6), it was found 1 % CNF foams have a higher thermal degradation point of (onset temperature) 277 (cid:3)C when compared to the other combinations tested. (Ptersson et al. 2007) indicated that the onset temperature of cellulose nanoparticles is between 200 and 300 ((cid:3)C). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 10, col 1; End: pg 10, col 1)The addition of starch consistently decreased onset temperature with reduction from 277 to 260 (cid:3)C and 277 to 255 (cid:3)C as initial starch concentration increased to 3 and 6 %. Switching the 0.5 % CNF to 0.5 % starch or adding more starch to the foam, decreased the onset temperature.  The DTGA (derivative TGA) temperature (decomposition temperature) of cellulose was found between 315 and 400 (cid:3)C by (Yang et al. 2007) and it was indicated in another study that cellulose has a sharp weight loss starting at 305 (cid:3)C (Moran et al. 2008). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 10, col 1; End: pg 10, col 2)In this study it was determined to be 338.6 (cid:3)C for 1 % CNF and when the starch was added to the structure, two peaks  were evident in the DTGA curves, one for starch and one for CNF (Fig. 7b). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 10, col 2; End: pg 10, col 2)DTGA temperatures were determined statistically different for CNF ? starch combinations, whereas they showed similar results that changes between 303 and 310 (cid:3)C (Table 6).

|promising raw material for the development of novel materials (Martins et al. 2009). It is a widely available biopolymer with a price half that of polyethylene and polystyrene. Annually, millions of metric tons of starch are used as non-food products in the paper and textile industries (Glenn et al. 2011). Starch is mostly water soluble, difﬁcult to process and has low mechanical properties. It was found that reinforcing starch with cellulose microﬁbrils increases the

|thermogravimetric analysis data were compared by conducting a one-way Means/ANOVA to check if there was a signiﬁcant overall difference (signiﬁcance level (alpha) = 0.01). Signiﬁcant different between groups were evaluated by use of a Tukey–Kramer Honestly Signiﬁcant Differences (HSD) test with alpha = 0.05. A sample size of six (n = 6) was used for all statistical analysis.

|Results and discussion 
--------------------------
|The large range in sample density (0.013–0.098 g/ cm^{3} ) resulted in all statistical analysis having signif- icant overall differences. There was a signiﬁcant effect of solids content on the porosity, density and relative density (Table 2). As expected, including less solids content in the suspension produced a more porous structure. The reason for the inverse proportion between solid content and porosity can be explained by the increased bonds with increase solid content between starch and CNF in the same volume.
