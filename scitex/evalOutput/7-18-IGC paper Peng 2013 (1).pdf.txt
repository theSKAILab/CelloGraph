	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 1, col 2; End: pg 1, col 2)Research and development of the renewable nanomaterial cellulose nanoﬁbrils (CNFs) has received considerable attention. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 1, col 2; End: pg 1, col 2)The effect of drying on the surface energy of CNFs was investigated. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 1, col 2; End: pg 1, col 2)Samples of nanoﬁbrillated cellulose (NFC) and cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) were each subjected to four separate drying methods: air-drying, freeze-drying, spray-drying, and supercritical-drying. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 1, col 2; End: pg 1, col 2)The surface morphology of the dried CNFs was examined using a scanning electron microscope. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 1, col 2; End: pg 1, col 2)The surface energy of the dried CNFs was determined using inverse gas chromatography at inﬁnite dilution and column temperatures: 30, 40, 50, 55, and 60 (cid:2)C. Surface energy measurements of supercritical-dried NFCs were performed also at column temperatures: 70, 75, and 80 (cid:2)C. Different drying methods produced CNFs with different morphologies which in turn signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced their surface energy. Supercritical-drying resulted in NFCs having a dispersion component of surface energy of 98.3 ± 5.8 mJ/m^{2} at 30 (cid:2)C. The dispersion component of surface energy of freeze-dried NFCs (44.3 ± 0.4 mJ/m^{2} at 30 (cid:2)C) and CNCs (46.5 ± 0.9 mJ/m^{2} at 30 (cid:2)C) were the lowest among all the CNFs. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 1, col 2; End: pg 1, col 2)The pre-freezing treatment during the freeze-drying process is hypothesized to have a major impact on the dispersion component of surface energy of the CNFs. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 1, col 2; End: pg 1, col 2)The acid and base parameters of all the dried CNFs were amphoteric (acidic and basic) although predominantly basic in  nature.  (cid:3) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 

NEW SECTION: 1. Introduction  (Level: 1)


NEW PARA: (Start: pg 1, col 2; End: pg 1, col 2)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 1, col 2; End: pg 1, col 2)Cellulose, as the most abundant biopolymer in nature, is the most inﬂuential material in the history of human culture. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 1, col 2; End: pg 1, col 2)Its applications are diverse, and include housing, paper and textiles, pharmaceuticals, and chemicals [1–4]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 1, col 2; End: pg 1, col 2)Cellulose is the primary structural building block of trees and other plants and can be economically extracted from woody ﬁbers. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 1, col 2; End: pg 1, col 2)Regardless of its source, cellulose can be characterized as a high molecular weight linear syndiotactic homopolymer composed of D-anhydroglucopyranose units (AGU) which are linked together by b-(1 ? 4)-glycosidic bonds [1]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 1, col 2; End: pg 1, col 2)In woody plants, cellulose linear chains aggregate to highly ordered structures referred to as nanoﬁbrils or elementary ﬁbrils. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 1, col 2; End: pg 1, col 2)These nanoﬁbrils of cellulose are then packed into larger units to form microﬁbrils which in turn are assembled into cellulose ﬁbers such as the pulp ﬁbers. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 1, col 2; End: pg 1, col 2)Nanoﬁbrils in the woody plant are nano-scale ﬁbers with average cross-sectional dimensions of about 10 nm (cid:2) 3.5 nm. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 1, col 2; End: pg 1, col 2)They consist of crystalline and amorphous domains with cellulose chains parallel to the nanoﬁbril axis [5– 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 1, col 3; End: pg 1, col 3)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 1, col 3; End: pg 1, col 3)7].  Nanoﬁbrils are generally produced from wood ﬁber, plant ﬁber, pulp ﬁber, microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), and microﬁbrillated cellulose (MFC) using mechanical or chemical methods. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 1, col 3; End: pg 1, col 3)Processing dilute slurries of cellulose ﬁbers, including wood ﬁber, plant ﬁber, and pulp ﬁber, by grinding or high-pressure homogenizing action produces nanoﬁbrillated cellulose (NFC) [2,4,8], while digestion of amorphous cellulosic domains of the raw materials through an acid hydrolysis process produces cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) [4,9]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 1, col 3; End: pg 1, col 3)During the mechanical ﬁbrillation process, the treatment of the raw materials via oxidation mediated by 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) radical facilitates the disintegration of the materials into individual nanoﬁbrils [4,10]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 1, col 3; End: pg 1, col 3)These nanoﬁbrils are referred to as TEMPO-oxidated NFCs. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 1, col 3; End: pg 1, col 3)NFC can also be utilized as a raw material for producing CNC. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 1, col 3; End: pg 1, col 3)These CNC and NFC suspensions, which are denoted as cellulose nanoﬁbril (CNF) suspensions in this study, are produced on the pilot scale and are commercially available in US, Europe, and Japan [4,11–13]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 1, col 3; End: pg 1, col 3)A comprehensive review of the manufacturing processes for NFC and CNC was reported  by Dufresne [4]. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 1, col 3; End: pg 1, col 3)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 1, col 3; End: pg 1, col 3)With the availability of CNF suspensions in pilot-scale quantities, great opportunities are available for exploring their novel applications, such as the utilization of CNFs as nano-ﬁllers to reinforce polymers in the plastics industry [2,14,15] and as novel tablet

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)For these applications, drying CNF suspension is a prerequisite. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)A detailed study of drying CNF suspensions was conducted by Peng et al.  [17–19]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)The CNF suspensions, including NFC and CNC suspensions, were each dried by: air-drying (or oven drying), freeze-drying, spraydrying, or supercritical-drying. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)After drying, CNFs with various morphologies, crystalline structures, residue moisture contents, and thermal stabilities were produced [17,19]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)Knowledge of both the nature and magnitude of surface energetics of these dried CNFs is critical in optimizing the process of manufacturing CNF-reinforced polymer nanocomposites with desirable properties. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)The properties of CNF-reinforced polymer nanocomposites are controlled mainly by: (1) agglomeration of cellulose ﬁbers, (2) interactions between cellulose and the polymer, (3) wetting of cellulose ﬁbers, and (4) the distribution and dispersion of cellulose ﬁbers within the polymer matrix. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)These four properties are directly determined by surface energetics of dried CNFs. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)Surface energy measurements are also critical for using CNFs in pharmaceutical formulations, especially in the prediction of drug adsorption, cohesion, adhesion, mucoadhesion, dispersion stability, coating performance  and lubricant sensitivity [3,20]. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 2)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)The surface energetics of cellulosic materials have been investigated intensively using several different techniques: contact angle analysis of cellulose ﬁlms, powder contact angle analysis, the Wilhelmy technique, thin-layer wicking, inverse gas chromatography, etc.  [7]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)The surface energy data of various cellulose materials were summarized by Gardner et al.  [7]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)Among these techniques, inverse gas chromatography (IGC) is one of the most widely used methods and has been successfully employed for characterizing the surface energies of cellulosic materials [20–35]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)Cellulosic materials for different applications were investigated in the mentioned research work: (1) microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) for pharmaceutical formulations [20], (2) pulp ﬁbers for paper [23,30], and (3) cotton ﬁbers for the textile industry [35]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)The most relevant studies cover cellulosic ﬁbers for manufacturing polymer composites [28,29,31]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)As cellulose is a highly hydrophilic natural material, its incorporation into a polymeric matrix should be carried out in such a way as to avoid the uptake of water from the environment. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)At the same time, compatibility between the surfaces of these ﬁbers and that of polymers must be optimized for the improvement of material performance. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)When cellulose ﬁber is used in a polyoleﬁn-based matrix, the interactions between the ﬁber and the matrix are dominated by the ubiquitous Lifshitz-van der Waals (dispersion) forces. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)However, when cellulose is compounded with hydrophilic matrices, the Lewis acid–base (speciﬁc) interactions must also be evaluated. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)Generally, the surface of cellulosic materials is categorized as amphoteric [23,30,31]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)However, Jacob and Berg [23] indicated that the solid surfaces of cellulose are predominantly acidic while other research results show higher basicity on cellulose surfaces [30,31]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)The research work conducted by Dorris and Gray [21] showed that the dispersion component (c^{LW}_{)} of surface energy was (1) 49.9 mJ/m^{2} for cotton cellulose at 40 (cid:2)C and (2) 38.8 mJ/m^{2} for thermomechanical pulp ﬁbers (TMP) at 30 (cid:2)C. The measurement of the dispersion component of two MCC samples (Emcocel 50 M and Emcocel HD 90) using IGC was also conducted [20] at 30 (cid:2)C and 0% relative humidity (RH) and the results were 55.5 (0.6) and 45.6 (0.4) mJ/m^{2} . 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)The authors attributed the lower dispersion component of surface energy of Emcocel HD 90 to its higher density compared with Emcocel 50 M. Increased RH decreases the dispersion component of surface energy [20,29]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)Different material sources were also observed to cause signiﬁcant differences in the dispersion component of surface energy. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)The dispersion component of surface energy of 14 different cellulosic ﬁbers was examined using IGC and the results indicated that they differ within a range from 35.5 to 44.2 mJ/m^{2} [32]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 2)Crystallinity also affects the dispersion component of surface  energy.  Belgacem et al. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 2; End: pg 2, col 2)[36] demonstrated that MCC has a signiﬁcantly higher dispersion component of surface energy (41.0 mJ/  m^{2} ) than that of amorphous cellulose (27.4 mJ/m^{2} ). 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 2, col 2; End: pg 2, col 2)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 2; End: pg 2, col 2)For CNFs produced by homogenization or acid hydrolysis processes, the surface properties may have been signiﬁcantly changed during the processes of mechanical ﬁbrillation or chemical treatments. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 2; End: pg 2, col 2)Simultaneously, the fraction of surface functionality changes as the size of cellulosic material decreases and the hydroxyl groups at the surface of cellulosic material is different from the hydroxyl groups inside the bulk. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 2; End: pg 2, col 2)Moreover, the hydroxyl groups at surface of crystalline cellulose are different from the hydroxyl groups in the amorphous region of cellulose. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 2; End: pg 2, col 2)Characterization of the surface energy of CNFs is necessary. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 2; End: pg 2, col 2)At the same time, the drying method may further impact the surface properties of NFCs and CNCs. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 2; End: pg 2, col 2)During drying, cellulose ﬁbrils aggregation occurs [37,38]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 2; End: pg 2, col 2)The method of drying inﬂuences the size of the ﬁbril aggregate dimensions and the reaction rate of the dried cotton cellulose [38]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 2; End: pg 2, col 2)After drying, different morphologies, aggregation degree, and crystalline structures of NFCs and CNCs are formed [17,39]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 2; End: pg 2, col 2)Therefore, the effect of drying method on the surface properties  of CNFs needs to be evaluated. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 2, col 2; End: pg 2, col 2)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 2; End: pg 2, col 2)The objectives of this study were to measure the surface energy of the dried CNFs, including NFCs and CNCs, and to evaluate the effect of drying method thereof. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 2; End: pg 2, col 2)Samples of NFC and CNC were each subjected to four separate drying methods: air-drying, freezedrying, spray-drying, and supercritical-drying. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 2; End: pg 2, col 2)The morphologies of CNFs in suspensions and in dry form were examined using a transmission electron microscope and a scanning electron microscope. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 2; End: pg 2, col 2)The surface energy measurements, including dispersion component of surface energy and acid and base parameters, on each dried sample were performed using inverse gas chromatography at inﬁnite dilution (IGC-ID) and column temperatures: 30, 40, 50, 55, and 60 (cid:2)C. The IGC measurement of supercritical-dried NFCs was also conducted at column temperatures of 70, 75, and 80 (cid:2)C. The effect of different drying methods on the morphologies and surface energies of NFCs and CNCs was determined. Correlation between morphology and surface energy of CNFs is discussed. 

NEW SECTION: 2. Experimental sections  (Level: 1)


NEW SECTION: 2.1. Suspension preparation and drying  (Level: 2)


NEW PARA: (Start: pg 2, col 2; End: pg 2, col 2)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 2; End: pg 2, col 2)The NFC suspension was a commercial product, ARBOCEL MF40-10 at 10 wt.% from J. Rettenmaier & Sohne GMBH+CO.KG, Germany. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 2; End: pg 2, col 2)The CNC suspension at 6.5 wt.% was obtained from the Forest Products Laboratory in Madison, Wisconsin. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 2; End: pg 2, col 2)Before drying, distilled water was added into the original suspensions and mixed using a Speed Mixer^{(cid:4)} (Flack Tek Inc., US) for 4 min at 2000 rpm to obtain ﬁnal weight concentration of CNC and NFC suspensions at 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 2, col 2; End: pg 2, col 2)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 2; End: pg 2, col 2)0.001 and 2 wt.%. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 2, col 2; End: pg 3, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 2; End: pg 2, col 2)Different drying methods were applied to the CNF suspensions at 2 wt.%, including NFC and CNC suspensions, just after mixing. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 2; End: pg 2, col 2)Air-drying (AD) of the two different suspensions was performed in a conditioning room with relative humidity of 65 ± 5% and temperature of 20 ± 2 (cid:2)C. The suspensions were allowed to settle to a constant weight in plastic containers before collection. Prior to freeze-drying (FD), CNF suspensions (about 20 ml) were frozen in vials at a temperature of (cid:3)80 (cid:2)C for 24 h. Frozen suspensions were then transferred to a Virtis Freezemobile 25 SL freeze dryer, which has a condenser temperature of (cid:3)80 (cid:2)C and a vacuum of 11 mTorr. Lyophilization was allowed to continue for 72 h. Supercritical drying (SCD) of the prepared suspension was conducted on the Tousimis Samdri PVT-3 Critical-Point dryer. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 2; End: pg 3, col 2)Four steps were involved in this process: (1) dehydration of CNF suspension with a series of ethanol solutions (50%, 75%, 95%, and 100%) until water was  completely replaced with ethanol, (2) replacement of ethanol with liquid CO_{2} , (3) pressurization and heating of the liquid CO_{2} and the cellulose mixture to the supercritical conditions, and (4) slow decompression of the supercritical CO_{2} to atmospheric pressure. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)Spray-drying of the CNF suspensions was conducted using a Buchi Mini Spray Dryer B-290 laboratory spray dryer (New Castle, DE, USA). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)High purity nitrogen gas was used as an injected gas to form the suspension droplets. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)The spray-drying process is detailed in Peng et al. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)[17] and Peng et al.  [18]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)In this study, CNF suspensions were dried at an inlet temperature of 175 (cid:2)C, gas ﬂow rate of 540 l/ h, pump rate of 4.5 ml/min, and drying gas ﬂow rate of approximately 35 m^{3} /h. The outlet temperatures of the spray-dryer measured for the NFCs and CNCs were 100 and 93 (cid:2)C. All the dried CNFs were put in plastic bags and stored in a desiccator at ambient temperature for future use. 

NEW SECTION: 2.2. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)  (Level: 2)


NEW PARA: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)Drops of 0.001 wt.% NFC and CNC suspensions were deposited on carbon coated electron microscope grids and negatively stained with 2 wt.% uranyl acetate. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)The grids were dried in air and observed with a Philips CM10 Transmission Electron Microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV. 

NEW SECTION: 2.3. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)  (Level: 2)


NEW PARA: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)SEM studies on the morphologies of dried samples were carried out using an AMR 1820 (AMRay Co.) scanning electron microscope. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)All samples were sputter-coated with gold before the microscopic observations were obtained. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)SEM images were taken at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV at various magniﬁcations. 

NEW SECTION: 2.4. Inverse gas chromatography (IGC) theory  (Level: 2)


NEW PARA: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)The dispersion component of surface energy and acid and base parameters of the dried CNFs were measured using inverse gas chromatography (IGC). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)Inverse gas chromatography (IGC) is a technique to characterize dynamic sorption of gas on a solid surface. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)This differs from analytical gas chromatography. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)The column in the IGC is ﬁlled with the sample under investigation (adsorbent) and the mobile phase consisting of a probe molecule (adsorbate) with known properties is used to evaluate the surface of the adsorbent. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)A pulse experiment is usually conducted to determine the surface energy of materials. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)A controllable amount of the probe molecule is injected and then ﬂows with the carrier gas (helium) through the adsorbent in the column. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)At inﬁnite dilution, the probe molecules are injected at very low vapor pressure which indicates that the adsorption isotherm is located in the Henry’s Law region. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)The lateral interactions among the probe molecules are negligible and the adsorption depends only on adsorbate–adsorbent interactions [21,40]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)At the same time, the number of injected molecules is unable to form full monolayer coverage and primarily interacts with high surface energy sites on the surface. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)The surface information obtained from IGC-ID mainly indicates a material presenting the highest activity or enthalpy of adsorption [41]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)When probe molecules ﬂow inside the IGC column, equilibrium (or quasi-equilibrium) between adsorption and desorption of the probe gas on the adsorbent can be assumed to be obtained by adjusting the carrier gas ﬂow rate [42]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 1)After a delay, the probe molecules exit from the column and are detected by a ﬂame ionization detector (FID) or thermal conductivity  detector (TCD). 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 5)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 1; End: pg 3, col 3)The experimental parameter measured in IGC-ID is the retention time of the probes, which can be converted to the net speciﬁc retention volume by the following relationship [40]:  V_{N} ¼^{j} m^{(cid:4)}  F (cid:4) ðt_{R} (cid:3) t_{0} Þ (cid:4)^{T} 273:15  ^{ð1Þ}where V_{N} is the net speciﬁc retention volume per gram of sample (ml/g), T is the column temperature (K), m is the weight (g) of sample packed in the column, F is the ﬂow rate (ml/min) of carrier gas, t_{R} is the retention time (min) of the probe and t_{0} is the retention time (min) of a reference gas (usually methane), j is the James– Martin correction, which corrects the retention time for the pressure drop in the column [43]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 3, col 3; End: pg 3, col 5)With the known net speciﬁc retention volume of n-alkane probes, the following relationship can be applied [40,44,45]:  RT (cid:4) lnðV^{alkane} N^{Þ}  ¼ 2N (cid:4) a (cid:4) ðc^{LW} S^{Þ}^{1=2}  (cid:4) ðc^{LW} L^{Þ}^{1=2}

NEW SECTION: 3.1. Morphology of CNFs in suspension and in dry form  (Level: 2)


NEW PARA: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)The morphologies of NFCs and CNCs in suspensions were examined directly using a transmission electron microscope and the obtained micrographs of NFCs and CNCs are shown in Fig.  1. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)Both NFC and CNC showed needlelike ﬁbrils. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)NFCs showed greater dimensions (diameter and length) than those of CNCs. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)The diameter of individual NFC is around 10 nm with length ranging from about 100 nm to several hundred nanometers. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)A portion of relatively short and large cell wall sections (chunks) in the NFC suspension which was generated during the mechanical ﬁbrillation process were also observed (Fig. 1a). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)The diameter of the large cell wall section shown in Fig.  1a is around 250 nm. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)When compared to NFCs, CNCs showed more uniform distributed particles, which is the expectation of manufacturing CNFs using a chemical process. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)The diameters are below 10 nm and the lengths are in the range of tens of nanometers to several hundred nanometers. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)It is worth noting that entanglement of NFC and CNC ﬁbrils occurred when air dried at a concentration of 0.001 wt.%. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 1)Simultaneously, NFCs tend to form signiﬁcantly more network connections among individual ﬁbrils  than those of CNCs as shown in Figs.  1. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 2)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 4, col 2)Morphologies of the air-dried NFCs and CNCs are shown in Fig.  2a and b. The two suspensions formed solidly packed bulk  materials with different surface morphologies. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 2; End: pg 4, col 2)The water evaporation process was detailed in Peng et al.  [17]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 2; End: pg 4, col 2)Agglomeration of different sizes of NFCs was observed on the surface of air-dried NFC. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 2; End: pg 4, col 2)Parts of the NFCs were short in length and large in diameter (Fig. 2a) which is consistent with the observations in Fig.  1a and b. The surfaces of dried CNCs were much smoother than those of NFCs, indicating an even denser packing of CNCs than for NFCs. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 2; End: pg 4, col 2)This is attributed to the much smaller size of CNCs in the suspensions compared to that of NFCs. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 2; End: pg 4, col 2)The morphologies of freeze-dried NFCs and CNCs are shown in Fig.  2c–f. The dried samples from the two suspensions formed similar ribbon-like (or platelet) materials with different sizes, differing from air-dried CNFs. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 2; End: pg 4, col 2)The large length (several hundred nanometers) and width (tens to hundreds of micrometers) are the result of the lateral agglomeration of CNFs. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 2; End: pg 4, col 2)This lateral ﬁbril aggregation was discussed in detail in Peng et al.  [17]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 2; End: pg 4, col 2)The thickness of these ribbon-like materials can reach nanometer scale. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 2; End: pg 4, col 2)A close-up evaluation of the surface morphologies shows that the freeze-dried NFCs (Fig. 2d and f) are similar to those that were air dried (Fig. 2a and b). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 2; End: pg 4, col 2)The surface of freeze-dried CNCs (Fig. 2f) is smoother than that of air-dried CNCs (Fig. 2b). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 2; End: pg 4, col 2)During the freeze drying process, the nanoﬁbrils were ﬁrst conﬁned in the space between ice crystals during the freezing process [52], increasing the concentration of nanoﬁbrils locally. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 2; End: pg 4, col 2)At this point, the interaction among cellulose nanoﬁbrils is enhanced and the nanoﬁbrils form a similar agglomerate structure as occurring in the case of the air-drying process. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 2; End: pg 4, col 2)Therefore, the surface morphology of freeze-dried NFCs is similar with air-dried NFCs. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 2; End: pg 4, col 2)However, the ﬂow of water vapor from inside of the bulk materials (slow evaporation of water) during the air-drying process may disturb the surface morphology of CNC because of its denser packing. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 2; End: pg 4, col 2)This is not the case for the freeze-dried CNC. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 2; End: pg 4, col 2)No inside water evaporation occurred in the freeze-dried CNCs, forming a much smoother  surface (Fig. 2f) than that of the air-dried CNCs (Fig. 2b).

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 2; End: pg 4, col 2)The morphologies of spray-dried NFCs and CNCs are shown in Fig.  3a and b. NFCs and CNCs with a size distribution ranging from nanometer to several microns were obtained. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 2; End: pg 4, col 2)Fibrous NFCs were formed by attaching small NFC ﬁbrils to longer NFC ﬁbrils during the spray-drying process. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 2; End: pg 4, col 2)Irregular agglomerates of NFCs were also obtained. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 2; End: pg 4, col 2)Spray-drying CNCs produced spherical and mushroom cap (or donut) shaped particles. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 2; End: pg 4, col 2)The detailed information related to spray-drying is reported in previous papers [17,18]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 2; End: pg 4, col 2)The morphologies of supercritical-dried NFCs are shown in Fig.  3c and d. During the process of supercritical-drying, agglomeration of CNFs was minimized because of the zero surface energy of supercritical carbon dioxide [17,53,54]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 2; End: pg 4, col 2)Drying of CNC suspension using supercritical-drying process was not successful [17]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 2; End: pg 4, col 2)As seen in the SEM micrographs of Fig.  3c and d, nano-scale NFCs with diameters of about 100–200 nm were observed. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 2; End: pg 4, col 2)These micrographs have also demonstrated the large diameter and short length ﬁbrils which exist in the NFC suspension. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 2; End: pg 4, col 2)Simultaneously, highly entangled networks of ﬁne NFC individual ﬁbrils were observed in the SEM micrographs (Fig. 3c and d). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 2; End: pg 4, col 2)When compared to the other drying methods (air-drying, freeze-drying, and spray-drying), supercritical-drying preserved the original NFC nature to the upmost extent in surface morphologies, including size and shape.

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 2; End: pg 4, col 2)The adsorption behavior of n-alkane probes on the dried CNFs is determined by the dispersion component of surface energy. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 2; End: pg 4, col 2)Using the obtained net speciﬁc retention volume of the n-alkane probes, the dispersion component of surface energy of the CNFs is obtained using Eq.  (2). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 2; End: pg 4, col 3)A typical plot of RT ln V^{alkane} N^{against}  the molecular  descriptor (aðc_{LW} L^{Þ}^{1=2}  Þ is shown in Fig.  4. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 3; End: pg 4, col 3)The dispersion components of surface energy as a function of temperature are shown  in Tables 2 and 3. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 3; End: pg 5, col 6)For the various dried CNFs, different sample (cLW_{L}^{,} mJ/m^{2} )  (kcal/ mol)  Ethyl acetate (EA)  Tetrahydrofuran (THF)  masses were needed to conduct the IGC experiments because of  their different morphologies (Figs. 2 and 3) and structures [19]. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 2)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)Calculation of the dispersion component of surface energy generally requires the retention time of four (or above) n-alkane probes. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)During the IGC experiments on the supercritical-dried NFCs, only the retention times of two probes (n-hexane and n-heptane) were obtained at 30, 40, and 50 (cid:2)C and three probes (n-hexane, n-heptane, and n-octane) were obtained at 55 and 60 (cid:2)C. It was hypothesized that the peaks for the other n-alkane probes took too long to elute at these measurement temperatures (over 60 min which is maximum value provided by the equipment) because they were not observed in the chromatograms of the IGC runs. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)Under this circumstance, the dispersion components of surface energy of the supercritical-dried NFC obtained using only two or three probes were highly variable and were deemed not reliable. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)Therefore, the dispersion component of surface energy of the supercritical-dried NFCs at 30, 40, 50, 55, and 60 (cid:2)C are not shown in Table 2. Measurement of the surface energies of the supercritical-dried NFCs were performed at higher temperatures of 70, 75, and 80 (cid:2)C using the same two columns tested from 30 to 60 (cid:2)C. The results are shown in Table 3. The dispersion components of surface energy for the supercritical-dried NFCs are 60.5 ± 0.4, 54.9 ± 0.9, and 51 ± 1.1 mJ/m^{2} at 70, 75, and 80 (cid:2)C. The dispersion components of surface energy of supercritical-dried NFCs decreased linearly with increasing temperature. The temperature coefﬁcients of dispersion component of surface energy (dc^{LW}_{/dT)} are (cid:3)0.81 and (cid:3)1.09 mJ m^{(cid:3)2} K^{(cid:3)1} and the linear correlation coefﬁcients (R^{2} ) are 0.99 and 0.98 as shown in Table 3. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 2)Based on the linear relationship between the dispersion component of surface energy and column temperature, the dispersion component of sur-  face energy of supercritical-dried NFCs at 30, 40, 50, 55, and 60 (cid:2)C can be obtained by extrapolation. At 30, 40, 50, 55 and 60 (cid:2)C, the dispersion component of surface energy of supercritical-dried NFCs are 98.3 ± 5.75, 88.8 ± 4.4, 79.3 ± 3.0, 74.5 ± 2.3 and 69.7 ± 1.6 mJ/  m^{2} , which are shown in Table 3. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 5, col 2; End: pg 7, col 2)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 2; End: pg 5, col 2)A comparison of the dispersion components of surface energy for the dried CNFs at temperatures of 30, 40, 50, 55, and 60 (cid:2)C is shown in Table 2 and Fig. 5. Different drying methods resulted in different dispersion component of surface energy of the dried CNFs. Supercritical-dried NFCs have the highest dispersion component of surface energy when compared to CNFs dried by other methods. Supercritical-drying formed single NFCs as shown in Fig. 3c and d. Supercritical-drying preserved the nature of NFCs with the lowest crystallinity index [19]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 2; End: pg 5, col 2)A higher dispersion component of surface energy of cellulose (116 mJ/m^{2} ) at 30 (cid:2)C generated by solvent exchange was reported by Lee and Luner [22]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 2; End: pg 5, col 2)During the supercritical-drying process, the organic solvent ethanol was also used to replace the water in the NFC suspension. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 2; End: pg 5, col 2)After drying, reduced agglomeration of NFCs was observed with presumably more exposed surface hydroxyl groups than those of CNFs dried by other methods. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 2; End: pg 5, col 2)The supercritical-dried NFCs have the lowest moisture content of the dried NFCs shown via thermogravimetric analysis [19]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 2; End: pg 5, col 2)Therefore, more hydroxyl groups which mainly contribute to the dispersion component of surface energy of cellulose materials [25] are exposed on the surface, resulting in the high dispersion component of surface energy. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 2; End: pg 6, col 2)Simultaneously, the highest temperature coefﬁcient of dispersion component of surface energy ((cid:3)0.95 ± 0.14 mJ/(m^{2} K)) is obtained for the supercriticaldried NFCs (Table 3) within the temperature range of 70–80 (cid:2)C,  followed by the air-dried CNCs ((cid:3)0.60 mJ/(m^{2} K)) within the  temperature range of 30–60 (cid:2)C (Table 2). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 7, col 1; End: pg 7, col 1)All the dispersion components of surface energy decreased linearly with increasing temperature. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 7, col 1; End: pg 7, col 1)The temperature coefﬁcients of dispersion component of surface energy (dc^{LW}_{/dT)} and the linear correlation coefﬁcient (R^{2} ) for all the other CNF samples are shown in Tables 2. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 7, col 1; End: pg 7, col 1)All the other dried CNFs have much smaller temperature coefﬁcients than the supercritical-dried NFCs and air-dried CNCs, ranging from (cid:3)0.18 to (cid:3)0.34 mJ/(m^{2} K) (Table 2). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 7, col 1; End: pg 7, col 1)These values ((cid:3)0.18 to (cid:3)0.34 mJ/(m^{2} K)) are comparable with the temperature coefﬁcient data reported by other investigators [24,30]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 7, col 1; End: pg 7, col 2)The high temperature coefﬁcient values of supercritical-dried NFCs ((cid:3)0.95 mJ/(m^{2} K)) and air-dried CNCs ((cid:3)0.60 mJ/(m^{2} K)) indicate a much more significant effect of temperature on the dispersion component of surface  energies of supercritical-dried NFCs and air-dried CNCs compared to the CNFs dried by other methods. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 7, col 2; End: pg 7, col 2)At higher IGC measurement temperatures, the thermal energy drives greater propensity for the reorientation of the surface hydroxyl groups for supercriticaldried individual NFC. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 7, col 2; End: pg 7, col 2)In the glassy state of cellulose ﬁbers, localized, thermally activated motions are able to force molecules in amorphous regions to rearrange [55,56]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 7, col 2; End: pg 7, col 2)Under this circumstance, hydrogen bonds built among the cellulose chains change with increasing temperature, forming more inter-chain hydrogen bonds and more stable sheet structures [57].

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 8, col 1; End: pg 8, col 1)This phenomenon may partially explain that the reliable surface energy data can be obtained at higher measurement temperatures of 70, 75, and 80 (cid:2)C compared to that at the lower temperatures (30–60 (cid:2)C). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 8, col 1; End: pg 8, col 1)The rearrangement of the hydroxyl groups forming inter-hydrogen bonds among cellulose ﬁbrils at higher temperatures (70, 75, and 80 (cid:2)C) eliminates the strong attraction of probes through van der Waals force in the IGC columns because of the greater number of free hydroxyl groups on the surface of supercritical-dried  NFCs.

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 8, col 1; End: pg 8, col 1)The dispersion components of surface energy for air-dried NFCs at 30, 40, 50, 55, and 60 (cid:2)C are 52.4 ± 0.4, 50.6 ± 0.3, 48.5 ± 0.6, 46.6 ± 0.4, and 44.7 ± 0.3 mJ/m^{2} while these values for spray-dried NFCs are 52.6 ± 1.1, 50.2 ± 0.7, 47.6 ± 0.7, 46 ± 0.6 and 44 ± 0.9 mJ/ m^{2} . Air-drying of NFC suspensions was performed at room temperature for several days. The slow drying rate in this process allowed the proper orientation of the nanoﬁbrils with the establishment of a hydrogen-bonding network, forming bulk materials (Fig. 2a). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 8, col 1; End: pg 8, col 2)The interactions among nanoﬁbrils through hydrogen bonding may ap-  proach a maximum during the nanoﬁbril position rearrangement. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 8, col 2; End: pg 8, col 2)For spray-drying, the water evaporation rate is higher than that for air-drying. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 8, col 2; End: pg 8, col 2)Increased water evaporation is driven by the relatively higher temperature of spray-drying process (100 (cid:2)C). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 8, col 2; End: pg 8, col 2)When compared to air-drying, the higher drying rate of spray-drying may limit the rearrangement of cellulose nanoﬁbrils. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 8, col 2; End: pg 8, col 2)Therefore, the spray-dried NFCs were assumed to form fewer hydrogen bonds, indicating more exposed hydroxyl groups and higher dispersion component of surface energy than that of air-dried NFCs. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 8, col 2; End: pg 8, col 2)However, the possibility of forming denser packing of NFCs at the drying temperature of 100 (cid:2)C would lower the dispersion component of surface energy of spray-dried NFCs compared to those of air-dried NFCs. The denser packing of spray-dried NFCs can be demonstrated by decreased water accessibility, i.e. the less ﬁnal moisture content (2.8 wt.%) of spray-dried NFCs than that of airdried NFCs (4.1 wt.%) [19]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 8, col 2; End: pg 8, col 2)As a result, the dispersion component of surface energy of spray-dried and air-dried NFCs were similar. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 8, col 2; End: pg 8, col 2)This was determined by the compounding effects of different NFC rearrangement and drying temperature in air-drying and  spray-drying processes.

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)air-dried CNC at 30 and 40 (cid:2)C are 66.9 ± 1.6, 60.8 ± 0.6 mJ/m^{2} while the values for spray-dried CNC are 60.5 ± 0.8 and 58.7 ± 0.5 mJ/m^{2} . CNC is much stiffer than NFC because of the digestion of the amorphous regions in the manufacturing process of CNC. During the airdrying process, the effect of CNC rearrangement on the dispersion component of surface energy is not as signiﬁcant as that for the airdried NFCs. When compared to spray-drying, the smaller size of CNCs formed less aggregated agglomerates during the process of air-drying. Evaporation of inside water in the bulk materials may disturb the connections among CNCs which can be shown by the rough surface in Fig. 2b. Compared to the spray-dried CNCs, the higher dispersion component of surface energy of air-dried CNCs may be partially caused by the greater number of exposed hydroxyl groups on the surface. At the same time, spray-drying appears to promote the formation of inter-molecular hydrogen bonds by dehydration among CNCs at this relatively high temperature (93 (cid:2)C) [57]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)The formation of inter-molecular hydrogen bond would result in a relatively lower dispersion component of surface energy of spray-dried CNCs than that of air-dried CNC surface. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)The assumption of the temperature effect can be validated by the much higher temperature coefﬁcients of dispersion component of surface energy during the measurement for air-dried CNCs (0.60 mJ/ (m^{2} K)) than those of spray-dried CNCs (0.28) and air-dried NFCs (0.26 mJ/(m^{2} K)). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)The less aggregated CNCs have greater freedom and propensity to rearrange their surface hydroxyl groups under the effect of thermal treatments, resulting in higher temperature coefﬁcients of the dispersion component of surface energy. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)Similarly, higher drying temperature during the spray-drying process depressed the dispersion component of surface energy of spraydried CNCs compared with air-dried CNCs. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)The hypothesis of the effect of temperature on dispersion component of surface energy is further validated by the effect of rising IGC column temperature. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)At the IGC column temperatures of 50, 55, and 60 (cid:2)C, the dispersion component of surface energy of air-dried CNCs are 54.5 ± 1.1, 51.9 ± 1.3, and 48.8 ± 1.5 mJ/m^{2} while the values for spray-dried CNCs are 55.4 ± 0.2, 53.5 ± 0.3 and 52.3 ± 1.0 mJ/m^{2} . The differences of the dispersion component of surface energy between air-dried and spray-dried CNCs decreased from 6.4, 2.1, (cid:3)0.9, (cid:3)1.6, and (cid:3)3.5 mJ/m^{2} as the IGC measurement temperature increased from 30, 40, 50, 55, to 60 (cid:2)C (Table 2 and Fig. 5). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)At the IGC measurement temperatures above 50 (cid:2)C, the dispersion component of surface energy of spray-dried CNCs is greater than that of air-dried CNCs. The effect of temperature (IGC column temperature or drying temperature) mainly dominates the dispersion component of surface energy of the dried CNCs. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)Simultaneously, spray-dried NFCs and CNCs showed practically identical temperature coefﬁcients (0.28 mJ/(m^{2} K)) of the dispersion component of surface energy. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)The spray-drying process diminished the effect of temperature on the dispersion component of surface energy of the obtained CNFs. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)The rearrangement of surface hydroxyl groups and temperature experience of the cellulose ﬁbers during the  spray-drying process is the main reason for this observation. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 2)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)A slightly higher dispersion component of surface energy of airdried and spray-dried CNCs was observed when compared to the air-dried and spray-dried NFCs, respectively. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 1)However, freezedrying produced NFCs and CNCs both with similar dispersion components of surface energy and all the dispersion components of surface energy are lower than those of air-dried and spray-dried samples (Fig. 2). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 1; End: pg 9, col 2)The dispersion component of surface energy of the freeze-dried NFCs at 30, 40, 50, 55, and 60 (cid:2)C are 44.3 ± 1.2, 43.3 ± 0.4, 40.8 ± 1.0, 39.1 ± 0.6, and 39.1 ± 0.5 mJ/m^{2} . The dispersion components of surface energy for the freeze-dried CNCs are similar: 46.5 ± 0.9, 42.1 ± 0.1, 41.0 ± 0.5, 36.9 ± 1.1, and 37.3 ± 1.7 mJ/m^{2} . Identical drying methods generated similar surface energies on different materials, indicating the process of freeze-drying is the dominating factor which impacts the surface  properties of the CNFs. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 2; End: pg 9, col 2)The freeze-drying process consists of three stages: pre-freezing, primary drying and secondary drying. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 2; End: pg 9, col 2)In the pre-freezing stage, the cellulose nanoﬁbrils were separated from water as water changes to ice crystals, thus creating more concentrated areas of cellulose nanoﬁbrils. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 2; End: pg 9, col 2)Within the sample, high concentrations of nanoﬁbrils enhance the interaction among the nanoﬁbrils and form different degrees of cellulose agglomerates. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 2; End: pg 9, col 2)Agglomeration of cellulose nanoﬁbrils blocked the hydroxyl groups on each nanoﬁbril surface and decreased their exposure density. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 2; End: pg 9, col 2)As a result, the dispersion component of surface energy decreases. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 2; End: pg 9, col 2)As freeze-drying proceeds, the bound water left from the primary drying stage is desorbed from the cellulose nanoﬁbrils and further agglomeration of cellulose nanoﬁbrils continues. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 2; End: pg 9, col 2)Therefore, freeze-drying decreased the dispersion component of surface energy of the dried NFC and CNC more signiﬁcantly than the other drying methods. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 2; End: pg 9, col 2)In the case of CNCs, a smoother surface was generated during the freeze-drying (Fig. 2f) compared to air-drying and spray-drying, validating that the denser packing of CNCs caused the lower dispersion component of surface energy. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 2; End: pg 9, col 2)Another reason is the low temperature treatment on the cellulose nanoﬁbrils. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 2; End: pg 9, col 2)A study was conducted to investigate the effect of pre-freezing as a pre-treatment on the surface properties of wood [58]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 2; End: pg 9, col 2)Their results indicated that pre-freezing treated wood produces a lower surface energy than unfrozen samples.

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 2; End: pg 9, col 2)With additional IGC measurements using polar probes, the Lewis acid–base characteristics of the dried CNFs can be determined in the IGC-ID experiments. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 2; End: pg 9, col 2)Four polar probes were used in this study: ethyl acetate (EA), tetrahydrofuran (THF), acetone, and chloroform. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 2; End: pg 9, col 2)Among the four chemicals, THF is considered a monopolar basic probe, chloroform is a monopolar acidic probe, and the other two are amphoteric probes (Table 1).

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 3; End: pg 9, col 3)The acid and base parameters indicates that the dried CNFs were amphoteric (acidic and basic) with dominant basic characteristic (K_{B} > K_{A} ). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 9, col 3; End: pg 10, col 3)The acid and base parameters for  = air-drying, FD = freeze-drying, SD = spray-drying, SCD = supercritical- drying.  supercritical-dried NFCs are calculated based on the IGC measurements at 70, 75, and 80 (cid:2)C and the values are 0.69 ± 0.08 and 1.28 ± 0.14 (Table 4). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 10, col 1; End: pg 10, col 1)When compared to NFCs dried by other three methods (air-drying, freeze-drying, and spray-drying), supercritical-drying produced NFCs with higher acid and base numbers. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 10, col 1; End: pg 10, col 1)However, no signiﬁcant difference was observed on the ratios of base to acid numbers for all the dried NFCs, ranging from 1.5 to 1.9. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 10, col 1; End: pg 10, col 1)At the same time, no obvious difference was observed among the acid and base numbers of the NFCs produced from air-drying, freeze-drying, and spray-drying. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 10, col 1; End: pg 10, col 1)The CNC samples show slightly higher basic numbers (K_{B} ) than the NFCs dried using the same methods. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 10, col 1; End: pg 10, col 1)The ratios of base number to acid number for the CNCs are also slightly higher than those of the NFCs. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 10, col 1; End: pg 10, col 1)Grafting of the sulfate group (strong donor group) to the outer surface of cellulose nanocrystals changes the nature of the CNC surface [59,60]. 

NEW SECTION: 4. Conclusions  (Level: 1)


NEW PARA: (Start: pg 10, col 1; End: pg 10, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 10, col 1; End: pg 10, col 1)The effect of four drying methods on the surface properties of CNFs, including NFCs and CNCs, were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and inverse gas chromatography at inﬁnite dilution (IGC-ID): air-drying, freeze-drying, spray-drying, and supercritical-drying. The surface energy measurements, including dispersion component of surface energy and acid and base parameters, were conducted at the temperatures of 30, 40, 50, 55, and 60 (cid:2)C. The surface energy measurement of supercritical-dried NFCs was also conducted at column temperatures of 70, 75, and 80 (cid:2)C. Each drying method produced unique CNFs with different surface morphologies and surface energies. Supercritical-drying produced entangled individual NFCs with the highest dispersion component of surface energy of 98.3 ± 5.75, 88.8 ± 4.4, 79.3 ± 3.0, 74.5 ± 2.3 and 69.7 ± 1.6 mJ/m^{2} at 30, 40, 50, 55 and 60 (cid:2)C. Higher temperature measurement of the dispersion component of surface energy for supercritical-dried NFCs at 70, 75, and 80 (cid:2)C decreased the values to 60.5, 54.9, and 51 mJ/m^{2} . Different degrees of agglomeration were observed for CNFs produced by air-drying, freeze-drying, and spray-drying, inﬂuencing the surface energies. The dispersion component of surface energy of the freeze-dried NFCs (44.3 ± 0.4 mJ/ m^{2} at 30 (cid:2)C) and CNCs (46.5 ± 0.9 mJ/m^{2} at 30 (cid:2)C) were the lowest among all the CNFs. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 10, col 1; End: pg 10, col 1)Pre-freezing treatment mainly contributes to the observed differences in surface energy. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 10, col 1; End: pg 10, col 1)The dispersion component of surface energy of all the dried CNFs decreased linearly with increasing temperatures from 30 to 60 (cid:2)C. This is also true for supercritical-dried NFCs from 70 to 80 (cid:2)C. The temperature coefﬁcients of the dispersion component of surface energy (dc^{LW}_{/dT)} for supercritical-dried NFCs from 70 to 80 (cid:2)C ((cid:3)0.95 ± 0.14 mJ/(m^{2} K)) and air-dried CNCs from 30 to 60 (cid:2)C (0.61 ± 0.01 mJ/(m^{2} K)) were much greater than for the other drying treatments, indicating a signiﬁcant effect of temperature on dispersion component of surface  energy. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 10, col 1; End: pg 10, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 10, col 1; End: pg 10, col 1)The acid–base components obtained from the IGC measurements indicated that the dried CNFs were amphoteric (acidic and basic) although predominantly basic in nature. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 10, col 1; End: pg 10, col 1)The CNC samples show slightly higher basic numbers (K_{B} ) than the NFCs using the same drying methods. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 10, col 1; End: pg 10, col 1)The ratios of base number to acid number for the CNCs are also slightly higher than those of the NFCs. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 10, col 1; End: pg 10, col 1)Grafting of the sulfate group (strong donor group) to the CNCs outer surface is probably the reason causing the different acid and base parameters of CNCs and NFCs.
