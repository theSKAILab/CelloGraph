NEW SECTION: Abstract This paper provides a review of the scientiﬁc literature concerned with adhesion and surface properties of cellulose and nanocellulose. Cellulose is the most abundant chemical compound on earth and its natural afﬁnity for self-adhesion has long been recognized. The ease of adhesion that occurs in cellulose has contributed to its use in paper and other ﬁber-based composite materials. Cellulose adhesion, which has received considerable attention over the past half century, occurs over a practical length scale ranging from the nanoscale to millimeters. Adhesion theories that have been examined in the bonding of cellulose ﬁbers include: mechanical interlocking, adsorption or wetting theory, diffusion theory, and the theory of weak boundary layers. Cellulose ﬁbers on the nanoscale are prepared in four different ways: (1) bacterial cellulose nanoﬁbers, (2) cellulose nanoﬁbers by electrospinning, (3) microﬁbrillated cellulose plant cell ﬁbers and (4) nanorods or cellulose whiskers. Structure and properties of nanocellulose that are important include: morphology, crystalline structure, surface properties, chemical and physical properties, and properties in liquid suspension. Cellulosic nanoﬁbers present a very high surface area which makes the adhesion properties the most important parameter to control for nanocomposite applications. In this paper, we will focus on discussion of the adhesion and surface characteristics of cellulose nanoﬁbers that impact its properties and application in nanomaterials.  (Level: 1)

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)Nanomaterials derived from renewable biomaterials, especially cellulose and lignocellulose, will undoubtedly play a large role in the nanotechnology research effort. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)To exploit their potential, R&D investments must be made in the science and engineering that will fully determine the properties and characteristics of cellulose and lignocellulose at the nanoscale, develop the technologies to manipulate self-assembly and multifunctionallity, and develop these new technologies to the point where industry can produce  advanced and cost-competitive cellulose and lignocellulose-based products [1].

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)The mechanical performance of composites, for instance, is dependent on the degree of dispersion of the ﬁbers in the matrix polymer and the nature and intensity of ﬁber–polymer adhesion interactions. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)To explain cellulose adhesion phenomena, it is important to review the mechanisms of adhesion. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)Several theories have been proposed to provide an explanation for adhesion phenomena; however, there is no single theory that explains adhesion in a general, comprehensive way. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)The bonding phenomenon is the sum of a number of mechanical, physical and chemical forces that overlap and inﬂuence each other. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)Based on this, it is not possible to separate these forces, and adhesion has been characterized as related to mechanical interlocking caused by the mechanical anchoring of the adhesive in the pores and the uneven parts of the surface; electrostatic forces, as they relate to the difference in electonegativities of adhering materials; diffusion which is related to the interpenetration of molecular chains at the interface where the adhesive and surface being bonded interact; weak boundary layers referring to the accumulation of air bubbles or lowmolecular-weight compounds from the adhesive, the adherends or the surroundings at the interface; and adsorption and wetting which are related to highly localized intermolecular forces. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 2, col 1; End: pg 2, col 1)Wetting may be attributed to acid–base interactions, weak hydrogen bonding or van der Waals forces (dipole–dipole and dispersion forces).

NEW SECTION: 3. Cellulose Adhesion in Paper Adhesion in cellulose-based ﬁber materials, i.e. paper, has long been recognized going back 5000 years when Egyptians invented papyrus parchments [7]. The ease of adhesion that occurs between cellulose ﬁbers has contributed to a globally important industry that is among the largest in the world. Cellulose ﬁber bonding in paper and related products occurs over a practical length scale ranging from the nanoscale to millimeters, and this topic has received considerable attention over the past 50 years [8]. The adhesion theories that have been examined in the bonding of cellulose ﬁbers in paper include: mechanical interlocking, adsorption or wetting theory, diffusion theory, and the theory of weak boundary layers. Most paper ﬁbers manufactured from wood pulp range in length from 1 to 7 mm depending on the species [7]. The bonding of cellulose ﬁbers in paper relies primarily on hydrogen bonding between the ﬁbers that occurs as the wetted ﬁbers dry in contact with each other, and the bond strength can vary greatly depending on the method(s) used to prepare the ﬁbers including the pulping, bleaching and/or reﬁning process. Hydrogen bonding between ﬁbers requires close proximity between adjacent hydroxyl groups (0.25–0.35 nm). The partial solubility of cellulose in water and the diffusion theory of adhesion have also been reported since reﬁned ﬁbers have a ﬁbrillar structure on the near-molecular-size scale that contributes to adhesion [8]. Mechanical interlocking has not been shown to be important in the bonding of cellulose ﬁbers in paper except for paper in the bone-dry condition [8]. The adsorption of hydrophobic materials on cellulose ﬁbers during papermaking greatly decreases ﬁber-to-ﬁber bonding and is related to the weak boundary layer theory of adhesion [9].  (Level: 1)


NEW SECTION: 4. Cellulose Adhesion in Films The preparation and use of smooth cellulose surfaces has facilitated experimental adhesion studies [10–13] on cellulose. Many researchers have prepared model surfaces of cellulose using spin coating [11, 12, 14], and spin casting [15] processes. Riegler and Sczech [11] prepared molecularly thin, smooth cellulose ﬁlms on wafer surfaces by spin coating a solution of cellulose dissolved in DMAc/LiCl. The cellulose layers were used to investigate cellulose/cellulose adhesion and their modiﬁcation by polyelectrolytes. Falt et al. [12] prepared ﬁlms of cellulose II through  (Level: 1)

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 4, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)They showed that the ﬁnal thickness of the cellulose  ﬁlms is dependent on the cellulose concentration of the solution; the temperature of the solution has no effect on the ﬁlm thickness but affects the surface roughness. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)Gray and Edgar [13] prepared smooth cellulose I surfaces from suspensions of cellulose nanocrystals obtained from acid hydrolysis of cotton and wood pulp.

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)[10] prepared three different cellulose surfaces, one crystalline and two surfaces with a lower degree of crystallinity. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)They studied the adhesion between two cross-linked poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) surfaces, as well as the adhesion between PDMS and the cellulose surfaces prepared. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)They determined that the work of adhesion was similar for all three cellulose surfaces, and from contact angle measurements with methylene iodide, it was concluded that dispersion interactions dominated the surface. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)They also found differences in the adhesion properties between the different degree of crystalline order probably because of the surface groups’ ability to orient themselves and participate in speciﬁc or nonspeciﬁc interactions; a surface with a lower degree of crystalline order has a higher  possibility for reorientation of the surface groups. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 5, col 1; End: pg 5, col 1)The different studies performed mainly on cellulose models have been focused on the electrostatic and adsorption or wetting mechanisms of cellulose adhesion. 

NEW SECTION: Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been used to evaluate adhesion properties of cellulose surfaces. Borkovek et al. [16] studied the interaction of cellulose layers with negatively charged colloidal silica particles. They found repulsive forces between the silica particles and the cellulose surfaces, which were interpreted quantitatively in terms of electrostatic interactions because of overlap of diffuse layers originating from negatively charged carboxylic groups on the cellulose surface. The authors concluded that nonelectrostatic forces, probably originating from hydrogen bonding, dominate the adsorption of cellulose onto probe surfaces. The electrostatic contribution to desorption forces could be detected only at a high pH, where the silica surface is highly charged. Zhang and Young [17] determined the adhesion properties of acetone extracted cellulose ﬁlms, which are rich in –OH groups. Both standard silicon nitride tips as well as self-assembled monolayer modiﬁed goldcoated tips containing a variety of speciﬁc functional groups were used to make the surface analyses. The authors determined that the adhesion force detected with –COOH terminated tips (approx. 34.8 nN) was much larger than that with –CH_{3} terminated tips (16.7 nN), which was attributed to the hydrogen bonding between –COOH and –OH functional groups. The adhesion force of –NH_{2} terminated AFM tips on acetone extracted cellulose ﬁlm was 42.9 nN, the strongest adhesion behavior, because of acid–base interaction was observed after introducing NH_{2} groups on the surface ﬁlms (using hydrazine plasma treatment) and using AFM tips terminated with –COOH. Conversely, the adhesion forces were reduced to 17.4 and 19.4 nN after their treatment with argon and oxygen based plasmas, respectively, probably as a result of greatly enhanced surface roughness of the ﬁlms.

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 6, col 1; End: pg 6, col 1)The interaction was attributed to the negative charge of the cellulose surface. 

NEW SECTION: Surface energy or surface wettability as an indication of the adhesion properties of cellulose has been widely studied using techniques that include thin-layer wicking [19], liquid absorption into cellulose pulp sheets [20], powder contact angle analysis [21], contact angle analysis of cellulose ﬁlms [22, 23], the Whilhelmy technique [24], inverse gas chromatography [25–27] and atomic force microscopy [16, 17, 28].

NEW SECTION: 5. Challenges of Cellulose Adhesion on the Nanoscale  (Level: 1)


NEW SECTION: The ease of adhesion between pulp ﬁbers that occurs during papermaking poses challenges to processing cellulose on the nanoscale. The hydrogen bonds present on the surface of nanoﬁbers or nanorods (whiskers) or of cellulose are the key for a better manageability of these new materials to determine future applications. These applications will be strongly dependent on the surface properties of nanocellulosic materials and their capability to be compatible with the matrix in which they are processed. There are four types of nanocellulose depending on their manner of fabrication. These include: bacterial cellulose, electrospun cellulose, microﬁbrillated cellulose (MFC) and whiskers of cellulose (nanorods). A review of each of them is presented in the following paragraphs.  (Level: 1)


NEW SECTION: Bacterial cellulose is a nanomaterial derived from various strains of Acetobacter species [30, 31]; although strains of pseudomonas, Achrobacter, Alcaligene, Aerobacter and Azotobacter [32] also can be used to produce cellulose. An in-depth review of cellulose biosynthesis and function in bacteria was presented by Ross et al. [33], but a brief description of experimental details is presented here. The Acetobacter species is cultivated in a medium containing carbon and nitrogen sources in either a static or shaken environment [31]. However, oxygen is needed for cell division and cellulose synthesis and if oxygen is removed and replaced by pure nitrogen, no cellulose is obtained [34]. The bacterial cellulose is in network form containing pellicles of ribbon shaped cellulose ﬁbrils that are less then 100 nm wide and are made of microﬁbrils 2–4 nm in diameter [35]. Typical uses for the microbial derived nanocellulose range from medical applications [31], reinforcement in high quality papers [36], diaphragms for electro-acoustic transducers [37], paint additives, coatings, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics [32], and reinforcement for optically transparent ﬁlms [38]. Wan et al. [31] researched the use of bacterial cellulose for reinforcement in medical materials. Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) was mechanically enhanced with the addition of bacterial cellulose. The addition of the bacterial cellulose allowed PVA, which has similar mechanical properties to various biological tissues, to be “tunable” over a broad range allowing the material to closely match various tissues for many medical applications. Nogi et al. [38] found that bacterial cellulose nanoﬁbers could be used as reinforcement in optically transparent materials. The ability to reinforce transparent materials is because of its high Young’s modulus and tensile strength of 138 and 2 GPa, respectively [39, 40]. Also, bacterial cellulose has a very low thermal expansion of only 0.1^{×} 10^{−6} K^{−1} [39]. The resin used was acrylic and to maintain transparency, ﬁber content ranged from 7.4 to 66.1 wt%. The ﬁndings indicated that at 7.4 wt% reinforcement the light transmittance was reduced by 2.4% and the thermal expansion coefﬁcient was reduced from 86^{×} 10^{−6}  (Level: 2)

NEW SECTION: 5.1.1. Adhesion Bacterial cellulose is more ordered than standard cellulose and this order and lack of irregularities leads to both superior reinforcement and thermal expansion properties when used with matrix materials. The inter- and intra-molecular binding and/or adhesion is accomplished through hydrogen bonding. Bacterial cellulose ﬁbers have a degree of polymerization between 2000 and 6000 [36]. This relatively low degree of polymerization may limit the adhesion through interpenetrating networks or mechanical interlocking and, for the most part, the adhesion in composite materials is limited to hydrogen bonding though other mechanisms of adhesion need to be explored. The elastic modulus of a single bacterial cellulose ﬁber has been determined by Guhados et al. [41]. The researchers worked with an atomic force microscope (AFM) to determine Young’s modulus by utilizing a nanoscale 3-point bending apparatus. The nanomechanical testing was done in force-volume mode where the cantilever deﬂection of the AFM is recorded as a function of vertical sample displacement.  (Level: 3)

NEW SECTION: Microﬁbrillated cellulose (MFC) is a material derived by disintegrating digested cellulose through a homogenizing process, exposing the underlying microﬁbrils. This new morphology was developed by Turbak et al. [53] in the early 1980s. This process usually starts with wood pulp; however, Dufresne et al. [54], describe how microﬁbrillated cellulose can be extracted from sugar beets. Regardless of the starting material, the process always involves a homogenization process. Nakagaito and Yano [55] describe the homogenizing process as subjecting the cellulose to a reciprocating motion producing a high pressure drop resulting in shearing and impact forces. The shearing and impact forces are responsible for exposing the substructural cellulose microﬁbrils. Through the homogenization process, the cellulose bundles are split and degraded leaving microﬁbrillated cellulose strands with dimensions of 10–100 nm [30]. Elementary kraft ﬁbers are on the order of 10’s of µm’s wide and are rod like [55]; whereas MFC is a network of interconnected microﬁbrils with little order on the nanometer scale, Fig. 4. Through the homogenization process the ratio of surface area to volume for the ﬁbers is increased dramatically. Nakagaito and Yano [56] researched phenolic resin reinforced composites where the composite mats had varying resin content. The MFC was passed through a high  (Level: 2)

Adhesion The interactions that take place in a composite between the reinforcement and the matrix determine how strong the reinforced material will be Azizi Samir et al.  [66]  worked with both microﬁbrils of cellulose and cellulose whiskers to compare the reinforcement properties for these two types of cellulose. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 15, col 1; End: pg 15, col 1)Cellulose was exposed to sulfuric acid baths at 40^{◦} C for 35 minutes. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 15, col 1; End: pg 15, col 1)Two sulfuric acid baths were used: one at 20 wt% and one at 60 wt%. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 15, col 1; End: pg 15, col 1)The polymer used was latex reinforced with 6 wt% ﬁber either untreated or treated in one of the sulfuric acid baths. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 15, col 1; End: pg 15, col 1)Results from the study showed that the tensile strength and tensile modulus increased when the cellulosic ﬁbers were added; however, the highest values were found for the microﬁbril cellulose with no acid treatments. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 15, col 1; End: pg 15, col 1)The elongation at break decreased for the material when the cellulosic ﬁbers were added and this is hypothesized to be due to the entanglement of the cellulosic ﬁbers. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 15, col 1; End: pg 15, col 1)For the reinforced material, the elongation at break increased as a function of acid hydrolysis strength. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 15, col 1; End: pg 15, col 1)All of this is an indication of the signiﬁcance of entanglement in the overall macroscopic  physical properties of the cellulosic reinforced composites.

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 15, col 1; End: pg 15, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 15, col 1; End: pg 15, col 1)Whiskers of cellulose, the needle-like structure of the cellulose crystallite, have been mainly studied for their liquid crystalline behavior in concentrated aqueous suspensions [65, 67–69] and for their reinforcing effect when added to a polymeric matrix giving rise to very strong and tough percolating networks of hydrogen bonded whiskers [70–76]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 15, col 1; End: pg 15, col 1)Whiskers of cellulose are renewable materials which possess high availability, light weight and high mechanical properties. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 15, col 1; End: pg 15, col 1)They consist of slender parallelepiped rods and, depending on their origin, the lateral dimensions range from about 2–50 nm in diameter for length than can reach several tens of micrometers [77]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 15, col 1; End: pg 15, col 1)According to these dimensions, they possess high aspect ratios and high speciﬁc surface area of about 150 m^{2} /g [78].

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 16, col 1; End: pg 16, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 16, col 1; End: pg 16, col 1)Several raw materials have been used for producing whiskers of cellulose. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 16, col 1; End: pg 16, col 1)These include sugar beet pulp, tunicin from tunicates (a sea animal) [71, 79, 80], mantle of the tunicates [81], valonia, sulphite wood pulp [82, 83], microﬁbrilated cellulose from kraft pulp [55], wheat straw [84], cotton ﬁlter paper [85, 86], bacterial cellulose [62], sisal [87], kraft pulp, hemp, ﬂax [88] and microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) [89]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 16, col 1; End: pg 16, col 1)Some sources for obtaining cellulose nanocrystals and their characteristics are listed in Table 2. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 16, col 1; End: pg 16, col 1)The method primarily utilized for obtaining the whiskers has been acid hydrolysis, which consists basically in removing the amorphous regions present in the cellulose ﬁbrils leaving the crystalline regions intact; therefore, the dimensions of the cellulose whiskers obtained after hydrolysis are mainly dependent on the percentage of amorphous regions that varies for each organism. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 16, col 1; End: pg 16, col 1)Traditionally the yields of cellulose whiskers by acid hydrolysis have been quite low (2–3%) [90]; however, in a recent study the process was optimized to reach yields up 30% and suspensions of nanocrystals with a length between 200 and 400 nm and  a width less than 10 nm [89]. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 16, col 1; End: pg 16, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 16, col 1; End: pg 16, col 1)Hydrochloric acid also has been used for obtaining cellulose whiskers; however, the use of sulfuric acid leads to more stable whiskers aqueous suspensions [74, 78, 91, 92] because the whiskers present a higher negative charge on their surface compared with those prepared with HCl [93]; the repulsion forces are then also higher and the ﬂocculation between the nanoparticles is reduced. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 16, col 1; End: pg 16, col 1)Another way to achieve charged whiskers consists of the oxidation of the whiskers surface [94, 95]  or through an acylation process [96]. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 16, col 1; End: pg 17, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 16, col 1; End: pg 16, col 1)Nanocomposite ﬁlms either by ﬁlm casting (water evaporation) or by freeze drying, followed by classical compression or extrusion, have been prepared to study cellulose whiskers reinforcing properties in thermoplastics [97–100] or thermoset matrices [72]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 16, col 1; End: pg 16, col 1)Water suspensions of whiskers have been preferred in nanocomposite ﬁlms because of their high stability and the expected high level of dispersion of the whiskers within the host matrix in the resulting ﬁlms. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 16, col 1; End: pg 16, col 1)This behavior, however, restricts the choice of the matrix to hydrosoluble polymers. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 16, col 1; End: pg 17, col 1)The utilization of latexes, which allows the use of hydrophobic polymers as matrix, is a practical  alternative and ensures a good dispersion level of the ﬁller required for homogeneous composite processing [79, 98]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 17, col 1; End: pg 17, col 1)The simplest technique to process a composite material from latex and aqueous suspension of whiskers consists in mixing and casting the two aqueous suspensions. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 17, col 1; End: pg 17, col 1)A solid nanocomposite ﬁlm can be then obtained by water evaporation and particle coalescence at a temperature higher than the glass transition temperature of the matrix [77]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 17, col 1; End: pg 17, col 1)Some polymer latexes used for ﬁlm nanocomposites include those obtained by copolymerization of styrene and butyl acrylate [77, 79, 101] and poly(hydroxyoctanoate). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 17, col 1; End: pg 17, col 1)Another alternative to processing nanocomposites using whiskers consists in dispersing them in an organic medium. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 17, col 1; End: pg 17, col 1)In this case, for improving compatibility between the polar whiskers and apolar matrices, the addition of surfactants and chemical modiﬁcation of the whiskers have been proposed [80, 81, 86]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 17, col 1; End: pg 17, col 1)Surface modiﬁcation involves reacting the hydroxyl groups on the surface of whiskers and in this way Grunert and Winter [62], for instance, used trimethylsilylation for reducing the hydrophilicity of the whisker surfaces. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 17, col 1; End: pg 17, col 1)The use of surfactants improves compatibility, but large amounts of them are required because of the high speciﬁc area of the whiskers [76]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 17, col 1; End: pg 17, col 1)Dispersion of cellulose whiskers has also been studied using polar organic solvents [79, 102]. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 17, col 1; End: pg 17, col 1)Dufresne et al. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 17, col 1; End: pg 17, col 1)[79] dispersed cellulose whiskers from tunicin in an organic solvent (N,N-dimethylformamide, DMF) without addition of a surfactant or any chemical modiﬁcation. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 17, col 1; End: pg 17, col 1)Gray et al. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 17, col 1; End: pg 17, col 1)[102] dispersed whiskers of cellulose in DMF and in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and prepared nanocomposite ﬁlms. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 17, col 1; End: pg 17, col 1)Cavaillé et al. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 17, col 1; End: pg 17, col 1)[72] processed and characterized thermosetting nanocomposites using aqueous suspensions of microcrystalline cellulose and an epoxy matrix. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 17, col 1; End: pg 17, col 1)They concluded that the reinforcing effect was due to the strong interactions existing between the cellulose whiskers and the epoxy network and the creation of a percolating network linked by H-bonds between cellulose ﬁbers.

	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 18, col 3; End: pg 18, col 3)The ﬁndings of Nakagaito et al. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 18, col 3; End: pg 18, col 3)[30] indicate that microbial cellulose has an advantage over other nanoscale celluloses because of its regularity and continuous alignment. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 18, col 3; End: pg 18, col 3)(2) The interest in electrospinning as a novel cellulose ﬁber production technology has increased over the past 5 years. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 18, col 3; End: pg 18, col 3)Through the electrospinning process it is possible to produce ﬁbers from 50 to 500 nm in diameter, with high speciﬁc surface area and small pore size. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 18, col 3; End: pg 18, col 3)In this way, several solvents for dissolving cellulose have been studied; however, there is still no consensus about the most appropriate cellulose solvent considering economics, safety and operational issues. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 18, col 3; End: pg 18, col 3)Also, although efforts have been made to characterize the surface chemistry of ﬁlms or membranes prepared with electrospun ﬁbers, the surface chemistry of the individual electrospun ﬁbers has not been clearly determined. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 18, col 3; End: pg 18, col 3)(3) Microﬁbrillated cellulose is fabricated by mechanical action called homogenization and results in different properties based on the number of homogenization passes. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 18, col 3; End: pg 18, col 3)These homogenization passes make strands of nanocellulose ﬁbrils that are used for reinforcement in matrix materials. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 18, col 3; End: pg 18, col 3)The cellulose microﬁbrils form an entangled network of ﬁbers which is shown to be an adhesion mechanism in MFC reinforced composites. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 18, col 3; End: pg 18, col 3)(4) Finally, whiskers of cellulose have been extensively studied for more than 10 years. 

NEW PARA: (Start: pg 19, col 1; End: pg 19, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 19, col 1; End: pg 19, col 1)Most of the research has been focused on the preparation of cellulose whiskers (using different sources), characterization and their incorporation in thermoplastic, thermosetting and/or biodegradable matrices (PLA) for nanocomposite production. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 19, col 1; End: pg 19, col 1)However, applications of cellulose whisker nanocomposites have not achieved commercial viability. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 19, col 1; End: pg 19, col 1)The traditional way to obtain cellulose whiskers is through a hydrolysis process which has been optimized from 2–3% yield to 30% yield (of initial weight). 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 19, col 1; End: pg 19, col 1)The interface between the polymer matrix and whiskers of cellulose and the dispersion quality of the nanocellulose in polymer matrices still need to be optimized for better interactions and improvement of the mechanical properties of the ﬁnal nanocomposites. 

NEW SECTION: 7. Conclusions–Future Directions  (Level: 1)


NEW PARA: (Start: pg 19, col 1; End: pg 19, col 1)
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 19, col 1; End: pg 19, col 1)As a generalized conclusion, cellulose adhesion appears to be dominated by hydrogen bonding across the length scales from macroscopic to nanoscopic. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 19, col 1; End: pg 19, col 1)Future work should utilize analytical techniques such as inverse gas chromatography and atomic force microscopy to determine surface energy and adhesion characteristics of nanocellulose ﬁbers. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 19, col 1; End: pg 19, col 1)From such studies, surface sizing needs can be determined for nanocellulose to aid in dispersion and improve interfacial compatibility in nanocomposites to maximize material properties. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 19, col 1; End: pg 19, col 1)Although some research has been performed to characterize cellulose at a nanolevel, through the preparation of molecularly smooth cellulose ﬁlms, it is necessary to continue research in this area to obtain a better understanding of the adhesion interactions beyond hydrogen bonding including mechanical interlocking, interpenetrating networks, and covalent linkages on a fundamental level to improve interfacial properties with thermoplastics, thermosets and biopolymers. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 19, col 1; End: pg 19, col 1)A number of studies have promoted the properties of nanocomposites such as lightweight, strength, biodegradability (depending on the matrix used), etc.,  however, only a few speciﬁc applications have been presented. 
	NEW SENTENCE: (Start: pg 19, col 1; End: pg 19, col 1)Therefore, future work should focus on real world applications where the  properties and/or economic justiﬁcations are better than existing materials.
