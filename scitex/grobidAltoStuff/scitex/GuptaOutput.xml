<ns0:div><ns0:p>Cellulose (C 6 H 10 O 5 ) n is one of the most ubiquitous organic polymers on the planet. It is a significant structural component of the primary cell wall of green plants, various forms of algae and oomycetes. It is a polysaccharide consisting of a linear chain of several hundred to many thousands of β(1 ͛; 4) linked d-glucose units. There are various extraction procedures for cellulose developed by using different processes like oxidation, etherification and esterification which convert the prepared celluloses in to cellulose derivatives. Since it is a non-toxic, bio-degradable polymer with high tensile and compressive strength, it has widespread use in various fields such as nanotechnology, pharmaceutical industry, food industry, cosmetics, textile and paper industry, drug-delivery systems in treating cancer and other diseases. Micro-crystalline cellulose in particular is among the most frequently used cellulose derivatives in the food, cosmetics, pharma industry, etc. and is an important excipient due to its binding and tableting properties, characterized by its plasticity and cohesiveness when wet. Bacterial cellulose's high dispensability, tasteless and odourless nature provides it with lot of industrial applications. Currently, about half of the waste produced in India contains about 50% cellulose which can be used productively. This chapter deals with the chemistry of cellulose, its extraction and its properties which help various industries to make the most of it.</ns0:p></ns0:div>

<ns0:div><ns0:head n="1.">Introduction</ns0:head><ns0:p>Cellulose is the most abundant biopolymer available in nature, since it is one of the major components of the cell walls of most of the plants <ns0:ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ns0:ref>. It is a homopolymer of anhydroglucose, with the glucose residues linked in a ß-1,4 fashion <ns0:ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ns0:ref>. Cell walls of plant cells attribute their mechanical strength to cellulose. Cellulose owes its structural properties to the fact that it can retain a semi-crystalline state of aggregation even in an aqueous environment, which is unusual for a polysaccharide <ns0:ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ns0:ref>.</ns0:p><ns0:p>As far as cellulose based products are concerned, paperboard and paper are the most commonly used ones <ns0:ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ns0:ref>. Smaller amounts of cellulose when processed under appropriate conditions, can be converted to a wide variety of derivatives, these can be used in manufacture of few commercial products like cellophane and rayon <ns0:ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ns0:ref>.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Since cellulose is a homopolymer of a glucose derivative, it is a great source of fermentable sugar. It is cultivated in the form of energy crops for the production of ethanol, ethers, acetic acid, etc. Besides energy requirements the industrial demands of cellulose are fulfilled by wood pulp and cotton crops <ns0:ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ns0:ref>.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Cellulose also fulfils the dietary requirements of some animals, particularly ruminants and termite, they can digest cellulose with help of symbiotic microorganisms present in their gut, while some organisms secrete a group of enzymes called cellulases to aid the degradation of cellulose molecules <ns0:ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ns0:ref>. Human beings are unable to digest cellulose due to lack of cellulases, thus cellulose acts as a hydrophilic bulking agent for faeces and potentially aids in defecation <ns0:ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ns0:ref>.</ns0:p></ns0:div>
<ns0:div><ns0:head n="2.">Overview</ns0:head><ns0:p>Among the various raw materials which nature has placed at our disposal for industrial purposes, cellulose has from time immemorial occupied a prominent position. Its abundance is attributed to the constant photosynthetic cycles taking place in higher plants, which can synthesize around 1011 ± 1012 tons of cellulose in a rather pure form. Since time immemorial it has served mankind either as a construction material or as a versatile starting material for chemical reactions for the production of artificial cellulose based threads and biofilms as well as for production of a variety of stable cellulose derivatives which are used for various industrial and domestic applications <ns0:ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ns0:ref>. Cellulose was used for various biochemical conversions even before its polymeric nature was recognized and well understood. In the process of recognizing and understanding its polymeric structure, it led to the discovery of nitrocellulose, synthesis of organo-soluble cellulose acetate and the preparation of Schweizer's reagent (first cellulose solvent). Another area of great interest was nanocellulose, the nanostructure of cellulose has proven to be advantageous because of its applications in a variety of fields <ns0:ref type="bibr">[11,</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type="bibr" target="#b10">12]</ns0:ref>.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Due to such great economical significance of tree cellulose, the current scientific focus is more towards cellulose biosynthesis as it is still not well understood <ns0:ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ns0:ref>. Most of the recent findings concerning the molecular mechanism of cellulose biosynthesis in higher plants resulted from research in model herbaceous plants and fibre crops and have been reviewed recently. All these aspects trigger a researchers' curiosity and makes them want to dig deeper and unveil other properties and applications of cellulose.</ns0:p></ns0:div>
<ns0:div><ns0:head n="3.">Chemistry of cellulose</ns0:head><ns0:p>The Cellulose is made up of a d-glucose unit at one end and a C4-OH group, the non-reducing end, while the terminating group is C1-OH, the reducing end with aldehyde structure. Some technical celluloses contain extra carbonyl and carboxy groups, like the bleached wood pulp. The molecular structure is responsible for its significant properties: Chirality, hydrophilicity, degradability and chemical variability due to high reactivity from the donor group-OH. The superior hydrogen bonds add crystalline fibre structures to cellulose. Figure <ns0:ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ns0:ref> presents the four different pathways which determine the major processing routes. The most famous and highly used pathway is the manufacture of cellulose from plants. It is established that cellulose is found in its purest form from the seed hairs of cotton. The wood cellulose, on the other hand forms a composite with lignin and other polysaccharides, which is further separated by large scale chemical pulping and purification processes. Cellulose can be derived from algae, some specific bacteria, and fungi, apart from most plants. The supramolecular structures are used for research on cellulose structures, reactivity, and crystallinity with further note on development of biomaterials and new substances. Cyanobacteria are known to biosynthesize cellulose for nearly 3.5 billion years <ns0:ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ns0:ref>. The first synthesis of cellulose in vitro is reported as the cellucellulase-cellulose formation by catalyzed cellobiosyl fluoride and the chemosynthesis was processed in a ring opening polymerization of the d-glucose moieties <ns0:ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ns0:ref>. A lot of research is ongoing in the field and study of cellulose over the past decade. The structure and properties of cellulose are quintessential to perform modifications and processing of cellulose on the whole.</ns0:p></ns0:div>
<ns0:div><ns0:head n="4.">Properties of cellulose</ns0:head><ns0:p>The structure of cellulose has been constantly a subject requiring intensive research as it is formed by the hydrogen bonds between the network of hydroxy groups <ns0:ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ns0:ref>. The progress was for more than a 100 years of intensive development on structure analysis methods like electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and high Major pathways of formation of cellulose <ns0:ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ns0:ref>.</ns0:p></ns0:div>

The complete detailed analysis is required for the procedures of synthetic reactions and cellulose based manmade products with extensive applications. The structure of cellulose as depicted in Figure <ns0:ref type="figure">2</ns0:ref> consists of hydroxyl groups of β-1,4-glucan cellulose at C2, C3 and C6. The CH <sub>2</sub> OH group is positioned relative to the C4 and C5 bonds along with a shear relativity with O5-C5 bonds. The solid state is equally likely to be represented in the crystalline (high order) and amorphous (low order). The crystal structure in particular is determined by the X-ray diffraction using a monoclinic unit cell which is made up of two cellulose chains in a parallel orientation and two fold screw axis <ns0:ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ns0:ref>. The investigations with respect to the electron microbeam diffraction, combined X-ray and neutron diffraction have clearly indicated that the cellulose crystalline structures have a triclinic and monoclinic unit cell. The schematic representations of the I <sub>β</sub> crystal structure, in Figure <ns0:ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ns0:ref>, indicate the two intramolecular chain-stiffening hydrogen bonds. The recent researches on the I <sub>β</sub> crystal structure have different H-bonds and different conformations of neighbouring chains. The thermodynamically stable cellulose II can occur in other forms of crystal structures and is the most stable form of cellulose. The cellulose I can be treated with aqueous sodium hydroxide to form cellulose II.</ns0:p></ns0:div>

<ns0:div><ns0:head n="6.">Extraction and characterization of cellulose</ns0:head><ns0:p>Cellulose is one of the most abundant biomass materials in nature possessing some promising properties. In our work, let us look into the various procedures involved in extracting cellulose from different sources. The sources available are many which can be broadly classified into Agro-waste, Domestic-waste (and other means such as wood, plant and paper). The processes involved include usual chemical procedures like alkaline extraction, bleaching, acid hydrolysis and chlorination. The final products can be characterized by using techniques like thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). Purified cellulose can be obtained successfully using the above mentioned procedures. In our study, we will be concentrating on the extraction of cellulose from agricultural residues and plants [26-28] (Figure <ns0:ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ns0:ref>). </ns0:p></ns0:div>

<ns0:div><ns0:head n="6.1.1">Extraction of cellulose from sugarcane bagasse</ns0:head><ns0:p>Sugarcane bagasse (SCB) is a key agricultural residue which has grown to be the point of interest in recent times. The extraction of cellulose from SCB was investigated using steam explosion and xylanase based environmentally friendly pretreatment for reducing chemical bleaching and to determine the characteristics of cellulose from sugarcane bagasse. SCB is a low value agriculture residue and about 40-50% of bagasse is the glucose polymer cellulose. There are several approaches to pretreat lignocellulosic materials to extract cellulose such as steam explosion, solvent extraction and alkaline treatment.</ns0:p></ns0:div>
<ns0:div><ns0:head n="6.1.1.1">Methodology</ns0:head><ns0:p>Cellulose is extracted from SCB by using steam explosion and xylanase pretreatment and bleaching process. The dried SCB treated with steam explosion at a pressure 13 bar (195°C) for 15 minutes to obtain steam exploded SCB fibres. Then, the steam exploded SCB is treated with 20 μg of xylanase using fibre to liquor ratio of 1:10 for 1 hour at 50°C under constant agitation. Then, dried steam exploded SCB is treated with xylanase (fibre to liquor ratio of 1:10) and then bleached with 0.7% sodium chlorite (NaClO <sub>2</sub> ) adjusted to a pH of 4 by the addition of weak acetic acid at 70°C for 1 hour. Sodium chlorite and acetic acid at the same loading were added to the reaction every 1 hour till the cellulose turns white. The cellulose fibres thus obtained would then filtrated, washed with distilled water until the pH of water neutral and dried at 55°C for 24 hours. The steam explosion process includes saturating the dry material with steam at elevated pressure and temperature followed by sudden release of pressure, resulting in substantial resistance of degraded lignin fragments, facilitates the release of lignin, which is then readily available for further bleaching and thereby increases the efficiency of the bleaching process Thus, the use of enzymes to treat pulp before applying chemical bleaching help to reduce chemical required in bleaching stage, breakdown of lignocellulosic structure, hydrolysis of the hemicelluloses fraction, depolymerization of the lignin components and defibrillization. In terms of bleaching treatments, chlorine-based chemicals were typically used for bleaching process resulting in chemical hazard released into environmental. Xylanases are glycosyl hydrolase that can catalyse the hydrolysis of β-1, 4-glycosidic bonds in xylan by means of double displacement mechanical reaction. This treatment improves accessibility of bleaching chemical to the pulp by decreasing diffusion [29] (Table <ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ns0:ref>).</ns0:p></ns0:div>

Rice husk is a major agrowaste that is generated in huge quantities. It accounts for 20% of the 600 million tons of paddy produced worldwide. People often dispose the rice husk waste using open burning which is an environmental threat causing damage to the land and the surrounding area in which it is disposed. This rice husk can be put into best use by exploitation of its cellulose content. Rice husk comprises of 33% cellulose, 26% hemicellulose, and 7% lignin. Thus, the use of rice husk as the primary source for producing cellulose fibres and nanocrystals is efficient. The strategy is to extract cellulose fibres from the rice husk using alkali and bleaching treatments.</ns0:p><ns0:p>An Update on Overview of Cellulose, Its Structure and Applications DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.84727</ns0:p></ns0:div>

It is also a major component of textiles made from cotton or linen. Further, its use is seen in the pharmaceutical industry as inactive fillers in drugs, in the form of powdered cellulose and microcrystalline cellulose. However, one of the most important uses of cellulose is in the production of biofuel and in the food Industry.

<ns0:div><ns0:head n="7.1">Use of cellulose in renewable energy</ns0:head></ns0:div>
<ns0:div><ns0:head n="7.1.1">Biofuel</ns0:head><ns0:p>A drastic increase in the population of the world coupled with an exponential increase in technological advancements and need of the people, fossil fuels are being rapidly depleted. At such an hour, the term sustainable development comes into play. In order to develop sustainably, it is important to switch to a fuel that is more clean, green and more cost-effective. One such alternative, is cellulose derived biofuel. There are numerous advantages of using biofuel, the first and foremost being cost-effective. Recent studies have shown that due to increase in demand, the cost of biofuel is decreasing as ethanol costs lesser than petrol and diesel. Further, there is a significant reduction in the carbon emission. The raw material used for biofuel is simply a substrate that has cellulose in it. Since cellulose is so widely abundant, the cost is significantly lower.</ns0:p><ns0:p>The ethanol obtained from cellulose is used as an alternative substrate in the production of biofuel. It is considered a superior source due to its high energy efficiency and low cost as compared to other sources. This is a very good source for renewable energy as it is found most abundantly in stalks, leaves and stem of green plants. Other sources for ethanol include, feedstocks, including wheat straw, rice straw, sawdust, forest thinning and grasses perennial grasses and switchgrass. Cellulose can be broken down into fermentable sugars by using the fungus Trichoderma reesei or by using acid to convert them first into sugars and then into gas. The gut of termites also can be utilized for this purpose. Further, a group of bacteria collectively referred to as methanogens have the ability to digest cellulose and produce carbon di oxide and methane, which is further processed. One group of such bacteria called methanobacteria grow anaerobically on cellulosic matter and degrade it to produce methane. They are also found in the rumen of cattle and the dung of cattle. As is seen from this, it is quite easy to obtain a substrate for biogas production especially by using waste cellulosic material. Therefore, it is important that to utilize even the apparent waste material to ensure a reduction in wastage and optimum usage of its potential <ns0:ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[34,</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type="bibr" target="#b31">35]</ns0:ref>.</ns0:p></ns0:div>
<ns0:div><ns0:head n="7.2">Use of cellulose in consumables</ns0:head><ns0:p>Cellulose has numerous applications in the field of pharmaceuticals and food technology. Modifying the structure of cellulose with other chemical groups results in the production of structures that have better bio-compatibility, flexibility, stability, emulsifying effects. Further, cellulose being indigestible by human beings, tend to have zero calorific value and can thus have been added in food to serve several purposes. Compounds like HPMC, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose and others are commonly utilized in the pharmaceutical industry and food technology industry. Some of these uses are enumerated below:</ns0:p></ns0:div>

It is regularly used as a matrix, adhesives, frame ingredients, the film creating material or in the creation of sustained or controlled release microcapsules and pellets <ns0:ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[36]</ns0:ref>.</ns0:p></ns0:div>

The cost of several pharmaceutical products is extremely high due to production factors such as high cost, difficulty in procuring the material, complicated processing steps etc. These problems can be remedied by the use of cellulose, which is found abundantly in nature. The most productive use of cellulose would be the utilization of plant based waste materials which are produced in bulk by many industries such as the sugar production industry as well as in minor quantities by households. The applications highlighted below could be brought to mainstream commercial use with the appropriate optimization techniques and novel modifications to the various steps of the production and processing of cellulosic material.</ns0:p></ns0:div>

Coating may also be used to facilitate drug delivery systems with altered release mechanisms such as delayed release, extended release, step-by-step release, pulsatile release and sustained release. Derivatives of cellulose such as esters and ethers are also extensively used as coating materials. In the process of solid dosage form manufacture by direct compression, a problem that frequently occurs is low compactability of the drug, this is more seen more frequently when the amount of drug in the formulation exceeds 30%. Many attempts are being made to reduce the price of the final product by experimenting with various starting materials and test conditions <ns0:ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[39]</ns0:ref>.</ns0:p></ns0:div>
<ns0:div><ns0:head n="7.3.2">Cellulose in drug delivery</ns0:head><ns0:p>From the advent of novel drug delivery systems, cellulose based models seemed like strong candidates due to their projected benefits. Since then various advances have been made with the aim to bring its use to common practice. There are still many hurdles to cross before this becomes a reality. Cellulose based drug delivery is an important step in green and sustainable pharmacy which focuses on toxicity reduction, biodegradability and less hazardous synthesis with respect to drugs and drug delivery systems. A very brief overview of the primary ways in which it is used is provided here. Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) have the potential to acquire a negative charge during hydrolysis. This coupled with their large surface area allow them to bind ionizable drugs such as tetracycline and doxorubicin permitting optimum dosing control. Sites for surface modification for multiple chemicals are provided by the multitude of surface hydroxyl groups. This is used in case of non-ionized or hydrophobic drugs which do not generally bind to cellulose. The open pore structure and high surface area of CNC based aerogels provide increased drug loading capacity and drug bioavailability. Extremely porous aerogel scaffolds were reported to attain sustained drug release <ns0:ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[40]</ns0:ref>.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Cellulose derivatives have also been researched in terms of drug delivery. For instance, cellulose acetate has been successfully used in several HIV drugs, five flavonoids, one pain reliever and two antibiotics among others. Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose has been used in oral drug delivery formulations <ns0:ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[41]</ns0:ref>.</ns0:p></ns0:div>
<ns0:div><ns0:head n="7.3.3">Cellulose in scaffolding</ns0:head><ns0:p>Scaffolds are materials that have been engineered to cause desirable cellular interactions to contribute to the formation of new functional tissues for medical purposes by providing the microenvironment required by cells to proliferate, migrate and differentiate. It contributes the geometrical basis and building blocks to provide cell attachment. Gluconacetobacter xylinus sourced nanocellulose is an emerging biomaterial for this purpose. Bacterial nanocellulose has a very high affinity for water and therefore displays properties similar to those of hydrogels which provides an ideal environment to host cells. Studies have confirmed that human smooth muscle cells, bone forming osteoblasts and fibroblasts and human embryonic kidney cells can grow in the presence of bacterial cellulose scaffolds. The main challenge in the production of these scaffolds seems to be biodegradability as the cellulose, the enzyme required to breakdown cellulose is not present in humans. This property was reported to be enhanced by periodate oxidation <ns0:ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[42]</ns0:ref>.</ns0:p></ns0:div>

<ns0:div><ns0:head n="8.">Conclusion</ns0:head><ns0:p>From the chapter we can conclude that cellulose is a highly versatile polymer which is easy to manufacture and extract. Its application in multiple fields has been discussed above. With increasing population, demand and technological innovations, renewable energy is gradually becoming imperative aspect of resource conservation and overall environmental health. Although various other polymers can be utilized for consumables, biomedical and pharmaceutical applications, the marked advantage of cellulose is that it is a biodegradable and environmentally friendly material. The intensive research on the chemistry of the compound, has resulted in the production of a wide variety of biodegradable products with a plethora of applications. An improved information of the many structural levels in which cellulose partakes will allow us to understand better practise of this exceptional and metastable molecular assembly produced by plant metabolic pathways. We have placed emphasis on the diverse applications of cellulose to promote more innovations that aim to bridge the gap between the amounts of cellulosic waste and its optimum utilization. Large amounts of cellulose based wastes are produced in every community across the world, which remain a largely untapped resource. Research that involves the conversion of this perceived waste into a widely used commodity would have the dual benefit of organic waste management and sustainable innovations.</ns0:p><ns0:p>© 2019 The Author(s).
